QUESTION 6: How does the FDA address the risk of microbial contamination in tattoo inks?

ANSWER: The FDA addresses the risk of microbial contamination in tattoo inks by:

1. Issuing guidance to help manufacturers and distributors recognize situations where a tattoo ink may become contaminated with microorganisms.
2. Recommending steps that manufacturers and distributors can take to prevent the occurrence of insanitary conditions or identify and remediate existing conditions during manufacturing and distribution.

5. Working with manufacturers and retailers to remove contaminated products from the market.

The FDA also considers factors such as:

* The wide variety of consumers using tattoo inks
* The fact that tattoo inks bypass the body's primary physical barrier against pathogens
* The potential harm caused by pathogens when inserted below the epidermis

Overall, the FDA aims to prevent the occurrence of insanitary conditions and microbial contamination in tattoo inks, and to ensure that manufacturers and distributors take steps to prevent such contamination.

QUESTION 16: I'm starting a small cosmetic company, what should I do first to comply with FDA cosmetic guidance?

ANSWER: Based on the provided context, since your company is considered a "small business" as defined in section III.A, you are exempt from registering facilities and listing cosmetic products. However, it's essential to note that this exemption only applies if your company meets the specific criteria outlined in section III.A.

To confirm whether your company qualifies for the small business exemption, review the definition of a small business in section III.A and ensure that your company meets all the requirements. If you do qualify, you can proceed with operating your cosmetic business without registering facilities or listing products.

However, it's crucial to keep in mind that even if you're exempt from registration, you should still comply with all applicable FDA regulations and guidelines for cosmetic products. You may want to consider consulting with a regulatory expert or attorney to ensure you're meeting all the necessary requirements.

Additionally, as soon as your company is ready to start selling products, you can submit product listing information under section 607(c) of the FD&C Act, if required.
