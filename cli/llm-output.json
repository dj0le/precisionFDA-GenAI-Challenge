      "answer": "The FDA addresses the risk of microbial contamination in tattoo inks by:\n\n1. Issuing guidance to help manufacturers and distributors recognize situations where a tattoo ink may become contaminated with microorganisms.\n2. Recommending steps that manufacturers and distributors can take to prevent the occurrence of insanitary conditions or identify and remediate existing conditions during manufacturing and distribution.\n3. Conducting surveys of tattoo inks available in the U.S. market and testing them for microbial contamination, which has led to 15 voluntary ink recalls due to microbial contamination.\n4. Alerting consumers, tattoo artists, and retailers of the potential for serious injury from use of certain tattoo inks contaminated with bacteria.\n5. Working with manufacturers and retailers to remove contaminated products from the market.\n\nThe FDA also considers factors such as:\n\n* The wide variety of consumers using tattoo inks\n* The fact that tattoo inks bypass the body's primary physical barrier against pathogens\n* The potential harm caused by pathogens when inserted below the epidermis\n\nOverall, the FDA aims to prevent the occurrence of insanitary conditions and microbial contamination in tattoo inks, and to ensure that manufacturers and distributors take steps to prevent such contamination.",

However, it does mention that a single listing submission for a cosmetic product may include multiple cosmetic products with identical formulations, or formulations that differ only with respect to colors, fragrances or flavors, or quantity of contents.\n\nIt is worth noting that the FD&C Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of cosmetics that are adulterated or misbranded. The text does not provide guidance on how to label products that meet both drug and cosmetic regulations.\n\nIf you're looking for information on labeling requirements for products that are both drugs and cosmetics, it would be necessary to consult additional sources, such as the FDA's guidelines on labeling for combination products (drugs and cosmetics).",
