QUESTION 16: I'm starting a small cosmetic company, what should I do first to comply with FDA cosmetic guidance?

ANSWER: Congratulations on starting your small cosmetic company! To comply with FDA cosmetic guidance, you should first determine if your business is exempt from registration and listing requirements as a "small business" under section 612 of the FD&C Act.

According to the guidance document, certain small businesses are not required to register facilities and list cosmetic product(s). If your company meets this definition, you may be exempt from these requirements. However, if you're unsure or don't meet the exemption criteria, it's best to proceed with registration and listing as described in the guidance.

If you do need to register, you should:

1. Register each facility that engages in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United States.
2. Submit a single registration for a contract manufacturing facility if your products are manufactured or processed at such facility on behalf of a responsible person (you).
3. Ensure that the responsible person submits a cosmetic product listing for each product, except if you're exempt as a "small business" or if the product is also subject to the requirements in chapter V of the FD&C Act (for drugs and devices).

It's essential to review the guidance document carefully and consult with FDA resources, such as their website or technical assistance documents, to ensure compliance.

QUESTION 27: How should products be labeled if they are both drugs and cosmetics?

ANSWER: Based on the provided context, it does not specifically address how to label products that are both drugs and cosmetics. The guidance document focuses on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for cosmetics and product listing requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

However, if we consider the broader context of labeling requirements for products that may be considered both drugs and cosmetics, it is generally recommended to follow the labeling regulations for the product's primary classification. If a product is classified as a drug, its labeling should comply with the FDA's regulations for prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, including the requirement to include a Drug Facts label. If a product is primarily considered a cosmetic, its labeling should comply with the FDA's regulations for cosmetics.

In cases where a product may be considered both a drug and a cosmetic, such as a product that contains an active ingredient intended for therapeutic use but also has cosmetic properties (e.g., a skin cream containing a sunscreen), the labeling requirements would likely follow those of the product's primary classification. However, this would depend on various factors, including the specific ingredients, their concentrations, and the intended uses of the product.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer on how products that are both drugs and cosmetics should be labeled without further information or clarification from relevant regulatory authorities.
