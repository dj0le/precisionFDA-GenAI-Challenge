QUESTION 2: What are the key recommendations for good manufacturing practices (GMP) in the cosmetic industry?

ANSWER:  The key recommendations for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the cosmetic industry include documentation, records management, and personnel requirements. Documentation ensures that products are manufactured and tested correctly by capturing every aspect of the manufacturing process through records and SOPs. Records should be retained in either paper or electronic format to capture details about operations, procedures, deviations from procedures, justifications, instructions (including training), specifications, protocols, precautions, corrections, and other measures related to GMPs. Personnel requirements ensure that personnel supervising or performing cosmetics manufacturing or control have the necessary education, training, and experience to perform their assigned functions correctly. Raw materials should be identified, stored, examined, tested, inventoried, handled, and controlled to ensure they conform to appropriate standards and specifications.

QUESTION 16: I'm starting a small cosmetic company, what should I do first to comply with FDA cosmetic guidance?

ANSWER:  To comply with FDA cosmetic guidance for your small cosmetic company, you should start by registering each facility that manufactures or processes cosmetic products. If you are manufacturing or processing cosmetic products on behalf of another responsible person (a contract manufacturer), only a single registration is required even if the facility also produces its own cosmetic products or those of multiple other responsible persons.

Next, for each cosmetic product manufactured or processed at your facilities, ensure that a cosmetic product listing is submitted by the responsible person. This includes both cosmetic products and any drugs or devices that are part of the same formulation but subject to different regulations (e.g., cosmetics containing drugs).
