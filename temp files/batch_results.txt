Question 1: 1. What is a cosmetic guidance?
Answer: According to the provided context, a "cosmetic guidance" is a document issued by the FDA that provides recommendations or suggestions on a topic related to cosmetics. These guidances do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities but rather describe the FDA's current thinking on a particular issue.

In this specific case, the guidance document is titled "Cosmetics: Limiting Exposure to Lead in Finished Cosmetic Products" and aims to educate new manufacturers and encourage existing manufacturers to follow or improve upon voluntary good manufacturing practices that limit trace amounts of lead as an impurity.

Question 17: 17. What are the best practices for registering a new facility for cosmetic manufacturing?
Answer: Based on the provided context, I couldn't find specific information on "best practices" for registering a new facility for cosmetic manufacturing. However, I can provide some general guidance based on the information available.

According to section 607(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, if a facility manufactures or processes cosmetic products on behalf of a responsible person (i.e., a contract manufacturer), only a single registration is required for such facility even if the facility is manufacturing or processing its own cosmetic products or cosmetic products on behalf of more than one responsible person.

To register a new facility for cosmetic manufacturing, it appears that:

1. The facility must be subject to the requirements in chapter V of the FD&C Act (for drugs and devices) unless the facility also manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are not subject to the requirements of chapter V of the FD&C Act.
2. A single registration is required for the facility, even if it's manufacturing or processing its own cosmetic products or on behalf of multiple responsible persons.
3. The responsible person (contract manufacturer) may submit the facility registration for such facility.

Unfortunately, the provided context does not offer specific guidance on "best practices" for registering a new facility for cosmetic manufacturing. However, I can suggest that you consult with FDA regulations and guidelines, as well as industry experts, to ensure compliance with all relevant requirements and best practices for registering a new facility for cosmetic manufacturing.

Answer: Based on the provided context, I couldn't find specific information on common mistakes with non-compliance when starting a cosmetic business. However, I can provide some general insights based on industry regulations and best practices.

The context mentions that small businesses with average gross annual sales of less than $1,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) are exempt from registration and listing requirements under section 612(b) of the FD&C Act. However, it also highlights specific guidelines for cosmetics, including documentation, records, buildings and facilities, equipment, personnel, raw materials, water, color additives, prohibited and restricted cosmetic ingredients, production, laboratory controls, internal audit, complaints, adverse events, and recalls.

Common mistakes with non-compliance in the cosmetic industry may include:

1. Failure to maintain accurate and detailed records of production, including batch numbers, ingredient quantities, and quality control data.
2. Inadequate labeling or packaging compliance with FDA regulations, such as incorrect or missing ingredient statements.
