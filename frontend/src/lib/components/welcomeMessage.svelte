			I'm your guide to FDA related questions. If this is your first time using the app, here's a
			few tips:
		</p>
		<div class="model-info">
			<p class="sub-title gap">1. Select a model</p>
			<p>
				On the top right, select the chat model you want to use. I'm a fan of Llama 3.2, but any
				chat model will work. Change it anytime.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-title gap">2. Upload your documents</p>
			<p>
				If you haven't already, you'll need to add your pdf documents to the database in the
				document section.
			</p>
			<p class="sub-title gap">3. Ask your questions</p>
			<p>
				Once you've selected a model, you can start asking questions. I'll do my best to provide you
				with accurate and helpful information.
			</p>

			<p class="sub-title gap">Examples</p>

					How does the FDA define "insanitary conditions" in the preparation, packing, and holding
					of tattoo inks?
