###### GUIDANCE FOR FDA ADVISORY  COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND FDA STAFF 

 Voting Procedures for Advisory Committee Meetings


This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking on this topic. It
does not create or confer any rights on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You
can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.
If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify
the appropriate staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

**Introduction**


###### I. Introduction

This guidance provides guidance on advisory committee voting procedures and is
intended for use by FDA advisory committee members and FDA staff involved with
advisory committee matters. This document recommends uniform procedures that can
be used for the voting process when votes are taken during advisory committee meetings.
This document does not recommend when votes should be taken.

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally
enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking
on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or
statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means
that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

###### II. Background

FDA's advisory committees provide independent expert advice to the agency on a
range of complex scientific, technical, and policy issues, including questions related to
the development and evaluation of products regulated by FDA. Advisory committees are
a valuable resource to FDA, and they make an important contribution to the agency’s
decision-making processes. Although advisory committees provide recommendations to
FDA, FDA makes the final decisions.


-----

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

Advisory committees typically communicate advice or recommendations to the
agency in two ways. First, FDA learns from the discussion and exchange that occurs
among advisory committee members, and from individual recommendations and
suggestions made during the discussion of any advisory committee meeting. Second,
advisory committees often vote on a question or series of questions posed to the
committee during a committee meeting. As the agency makes its final decision, FDA
seriously considers the recommendations made by advisory committees, including the
advisory committee deliberations and voting.

This document provides guidance on the procedures used for voting.

There are some advisory committee meetings at which votes are not taken. For
example, votes are typically not taken at meetings to discuss the development of a
clinical trial design or the development of a guidance document.

At other advisory committee meetings, members cast a formal vote on issues related
to the approvability of a product submission. In others, different questions may be posed
to a committee for a formal vote. Votes can be an effective means of communicating
with FDA because they provide feedback on discrete questions. These questions are
generally scientific in nature and can involve a range of subjects, including evaluation of
post-market safety data or pre-market assessment of a product's risk/benefit profile.
Since all members vote on the same question, the results help FDA gauge a committee’s
collective view on complex, multi-faceted issues. FDA recognizes that many of the
questions voted on by advisory committee members are complex and that the discussion
that accompanies the voting is important.. The discussion, together with the votes, helps
inform the agency’s own deliberations on scientific and regulatory matters.

Accordingly, FDA recommends adopting uniform voting procedures to help
maximize the integrity and meaning of voting results. In developing these
recommendations, FDA is mindful of the legal requirements of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (FACA), other relevant statutes (e.g., the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act), regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 14), guidance, policies, and the goals of
FDA’s advisory committee program.

Transparency and public participation are critical features of the advisory committee
process. The use of secret ballots, long a hallmark of the American electoral experience,
generally is not appropriate in the advisory committee context because the expert opinion
of each member should be clearly understood and identified with that expert.
Nevertheless, even with public balloting, the voting process can be managed to help
maximize the integrity and utility of the outcome.

There has been much discussion inside and outside FDA regarding sequential versus
simultaneous voting. Some have expressed concern that sequential voting, in which
members cast public votes in turn, has the potential to compromise the integrity of the
result.


-----

## Page 5

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

For example, scholars and social scientists have studied the risk of “momentum" in
sequential voting, exploring whether some sequential voters may be influenced, perhaps
even subconsciously, by the votes that precede theirs, especially if those votes are nearly
identical or signal a clear trend[1]. This potential risk may be aggravated in the advisory
committee setting, where votes are often conducted in full view of a passionate public
and participatory audience. In the case of sequential voting, there is also a potential risk
that comments made by a committee member or a designated federal officer (DFO)
during the vote could inappropriately affect the deliberations of those who have not yet
voted. Another potential risk is that comments could alter the meaning (or interpretation)
of the question at issue in such a way as to cast doubt on whether all the members voted
on the identical question.

**III. Policy**

Accordingly, to help maximize the integrity, consistency, and utility of advisory
committee voting results, FDA recommends that the voting process include the following
procedures:

  - The Chair and DFO of an advisory committee are encouraged to generate a robust
discussion about the matter at issue before any voting takes place. As part of this
process, the Chair or DFO should encourage the non-voting members to
participate in the discussion and should solicit the views of all members so that
any comment, insight, or concern that could influence a voter’s conclusions on the
matter at issue is heard and considered before a vote related to that matter occurs,
not afterward. The Chair or DFO should also consider in advance of the vote the
need for the advisory committee members to have an opportunity following the
vote to further explain any important qualifications related to their votes.

  - The question presented for a vote should have minimal qualifiers, not be leading,
and should avoid the use of double or triple negatives. When presenting a
question for a vote, the Chair, DFO, or other senior agency officials should solicit
and answer questions about its meaning before the vote begins. The objective is
to reduce any potential confusion and maximize the meaning of the voting results
by ensuring that the votes are based on a consistent and collective understanding
of the question at issue.

  - Voting should be done simultaneously. The objective is to avoid any potential
order bias associated with sequential voting and thereby enhance the integrity and
meaning of the voting results. The committee Chair or DFO has discretion to
decide the precise method of voting on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Examples

1  See, e.g., Callander, S. (2007): “Bandwagons and Momentum in Sequential Voting,” Review of
_Economic Studies, 74, 653-684; Banerjee, A. (1992): “A Simple Model of Herd Behavior,” Quarterly_
_Journal of Economics, 107, 797-817._

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

include a simultaneous show of hands, a simultaneous show of “yes” or “no”
cards, or a balloting method in which members simultaneously cast written votes.
The committee Chair or DFO should determine and announce the precise method
at the beginning of the meeting. Further, whatever method of voting is employed,
the names of the committee members and their respective votes should be read
aloud and otherwise made part of the public record shortly after the vote is taken.

- The question put to the vote should not be the subject of further discussion or
clarification while the voting is underway (i.e., whereas a discussion and
clarification of the question is encouraged before the vote, there should be no
discussion of the meaning of the question while members actually cast their
simultaneous votes). Once voting on a particular question has begun, that vote
generally should not be terminated until the vote is complete. Following
completion of the vote, consistent with the first bullet above, advisory committee
members may explain their vote. Additional clarification of the question after a
vote and a re-vote on a re-worded question may occur at the discretion of the
DFO or committee chair.

- In some instances, the Chair of an advisory committee may believe the committee
should vote on a related or relevant question not posed by FDA. If the Chair
wants to put another question to a vote on his/her own initiative, the Chair should
first check with the DFO or other senior FDA officials present to be sure that the
question is appropriate for the meeting, that it is consistent with the topic
identified in the meeting notices, and that it will not affect the conflict-of-interest
screening that had been completed prior to the meeting. If a determination is made
that the question should be posed, the Chair should discuss the matter with the
committee members before the voting begins to ensure that the committee
members collectively understand the question and feel adequately prepared (either
through the background materials or their own expertise) to render a
meaningful/informed vote on the new question.

- Briefing materials provided to advisory committee members as background
materials before an advisory committee meeting should be thorough and, to the
extent possible, include the questions that will be voted upon by the committee.
The objective is to maximize the meaning and utility of the voting results by
ensuring that the voters have had ample opportunity to study background
materials before the day of the meeting.

###### Guidance for the Public, FDA Advisory Committee Members,
 and FDA Staff: The Open Public Hearing at FDA Advisory
 Committee Meetings[1 ]

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create nor confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate
to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an
alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If
you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the
title page of this guidance.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) advisory committees play an essential

role in FDA’s activities to protect and promote public health through the regulation of

human and animal drugs, biological products, medical devices, foods, and tobacco

products. FDA’s advisory committees provide independent expert advice and

recommendations to the Agency on scientific, technical, and policy matters related to

FDA-regulated products. Advisory committees enhance FDA’s ability to protect and

promote public health by ensuring FDA has access to such advice through the public

hearing process as provided in existing laws and regulations. Although advisory

committees provide recommendations to FDA, FDA makes the final decisions on any

matters considered by an advisory committee. General procedures for FDA advisory

committees are described at 21 CFR Part 14.

1 This guidance applies to all FDA advisory committees including the panels of the Medical Devices
Advisory Committee. This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Special Medical Programs in the
Office of the Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration.


-----

## Page 11

FDA encourages participation from all public stakeholders in its decision-making

processes. Every advisory committee meeting includes an open public hearing (OPH)

session, during which interested persons may present relevant information or views orally

or in writing (21 CFR 14.25(a)). FDA’s regulation, 21 CFR 14.29, requires that a

minimum of 60 minutes per meeting be dedicated to an OPH session for oral

presentations, unless public participation does not last that long. For meetings that

extend more than 1 day and/or meetings with multiple topics, the OPH session can be

divided into multiple parts. If there is an overwhelming interest by the advisory

committee in a specific topic, then the committee chair[2] may extend the OPH session.

The time and location of the meeting and the OPH session is published in the Federal

_Register (21 CFR 14.20) at least 15 days before a meeting._

This guidance is intended to answer questions about how the public may participate

at an OPH session. This includes, but is not limited to, general members of the public;

individuals or spokespersons from the regulated industry (except the sponsor whose

product is under review); consumer advocacy groups; and professional organizations,

societies, or associations.

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally

enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking

on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or

statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means

that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

2 The chair is a committee member appointed to preside at committee meetings and ensure that all rules of
order and conduct are maintained during each session (21 CFR 14.30). He or she is typically an
experienced committee member.

**II.** **ORAL PARTICIPATION IN AN FDA ADVISORY COMMITTEE OPEN**

**PUBLIC HEARING**

**A.** **Providing a Request to Speak at the OPH**

An interested person who wishes to be assured of the opportunity to make an oral

presentation at an advisory committee meeting should inform FDA orally or in writing

before the meeting (21 CFR 14.29(b)). The interested person should submit the request

to the FDA contact person designated in the Federal Register (FR) notice announcing the

advisory committee meeting by the listed deadline date (21 CFR 14.29(b)). FDA staff

makes every effort to accommodate a speaker’s request. FDA recommends that the

request be submitted by mail, telephone, facsimile, or e-mail. If the number of registrants

requesting to speak is greater than can be reasonably accommodated during the

scheduled open public hearing session, FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the

speakers for the scheduled open public hearing session. FDA staff intends to contact

speakers regarding their request to speak at least one week prior to the deadline for

written submissions announced in the FR notice.

The interested person should include the following with the request:

     - Name of the individual or;

     - Name of the group, including the name of the spokesperson making the

presentation, a description of the constituency that the group represents, and a

brief mission statement of the group; and

     - Contact information (mailing address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax

numbers).


-----

## Page 13

The interested person shall also include the following in the submission:

  - A description of the general nature of the presentation, pursuant to 21 CFR

14.29(b)(1). The submitter may include an outline of the presentation to satisfy

this requirement. Whenever possible, all written information to be discussed

by the submitter at the meeting should be furnished in advance to FDA,

pursuant to 21 CFR14.29(b)(1) (see II.D below).

  - Amount of time requested for the presentation, pursuant to 21 CFR

14.29(b)(1). The time that FDA allocates to each person who wishes to make a

presentation is dependent upon the number of requests. FDA usually allots 5

to 10 minutes per person. However, if a large number of people have

requested to address the committee, FDA may reduce the time allotment for

each speaker pursuant to 21 CFR 14.29(b)(2) and/or extend the time of the

OPH session. In the interest of obtaining as many points of view as possible,

FDA may require speakers with similar statements to consolidate their

presentations into a single presentation, pursuant to 21 CFR 14.29(b)(2).

Alternatively, individuals and/or groups may choose to make a joint

presentation. In the interest of fairness, all speakers are asked to adhere to

their allotted time. If the number of registrants requesting to speak is greater

than can be reasonably accommodated during the scheduled OPH session,

FDA may conduct a lottery to determine the speakers for the OPH session. If

necessary, FDA may choose to extend the time for the OPH session to

accommodate registrants.


-----

## Page 14

Audio-visual/media equipment is available at advisory committee meetings. FDA

asks that an interested person provide a written request for use of the equipment along

with an electronic version of the presentation or any overheads at least one week in

advance of the meeting. The interested person should consult with the FDA Designated

Federal Officer (DFO)[3] on issues related to the compatibility of software/hardware for his

or her presentation.

**B.** **Confirmation to Speak at the OPH**

1. FDA staff intends to contact speakers by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone to

confirm their participation.

2. FDA may decline a request to speak at an OPH if the person wishes to address

a matter that is unrelated to the advisory committee’s work (21 CFR 14.25(a)).

3. As discussed in II.A above, FDA intends to assign a time allocation to each

speaker. In the event of scheduling changes and if time permits, FDA staff

intends to contact speakers concerning these changes.

4. If a speaker is delayed or is unable to attend the meeting, FDA recommends

that an FDA representative be contacted. If the speaker would still like to

make a presentation and time and resources permit, it may be possible to

arrange for an alternative time to speak during the meeting, to have the

speaker’s statement read by a speaker representative, or to have the statement,

or a summary of the speaker’s statement, made part of the public record via the

public docket. If the confirmed speaker would like a representative to speak

members, FDA, industry, and the public.

## Page 15

on his or her behalf, the confirmed speaker should provide a written

authorization to the designated FDA staff for the substitution. However, once

the public hearing portion of the meeting has ended, further oral comments

from the public will only be accepted at the discretion of the FDA advisory

committee chair.

**C.** **Confirmed Speaker Check-In the Day of the Meeting**

1. Check-in is at the registration table. Speakers should introduce themselves to

the DFO or other FDA staff. FDA intends to provide a designated seating area

for OPH speakers.

2. Speakers should work with the DFO or other designated FDA staff to facilitate

their presentation (e.g., slides). Any handouts should be submitted by the

deadline listed in the Federal Register Notice for the meeting.

**D.** **Submissions and Presentations**

1. FDA distributes to the advisory committee before or at the meeting those

copies of handouts received from public speakers prior to the deadline

announced in the FR notice, pursuant to 21 CFR 14.29(b)(1).

A copy of the written information provided by the speakers is included in the permanent

record of the meeting (see 21 CFR 14.60(b)(3)).

**E.** **Logistics of an Oral Presentation**


-----

## Page 16

1. FDA recommends that the Chair make a statement at the beginning of the

OPH session encouraging committee members that it is appropriate to ask

questions of OPH speakers if doing so might lead to information that is helpful

to the committee’s deliberations. The Chair should remind the public and

members of the importance of the OPH session to the advisory committee

process and that all speakers should be treated in a courteous and respectful

manner.

2. FDA generally will make available to speakers a podium or lapel microphone.

3. A timer is used to monitor each speaker. A visual signal (e.g.,

green/yellow/red light system), the Committee Chair, or the DFO should alert

the speaker when his or her allotted time has nearly expired. If the allotted

time ends before the speaker has concluded his or her presentation, the Chair

or DFO should advise the speaker to complete his or her final remarks and

conclude the presentation. In the event that the speaker chooses not to

conclude the presentation after being asked to do so, the microphone may be

turned off to end the presentation.

4. When the speaker’s presentation concludes, the Chair may ask the speaker to

remain at the podium for questions from the advisory committee.

5. All oral statements are recorded in the transcript of the meeting. Meeting

transcripts are posted on the FDA web site approximately three to four weeks

after the meeting takes place.

**III.** **FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE**


-----

## Page 17

The law requires that FDA’s advisory committee members who are special

Government employees (SGEs) or regular Government employees (RGEs) disclose to

FDA potential financial interests related to the topic of the advisory committee meeting,

including relationships that they may have with the sponsor and competitors of the

product(s) under discussion, when the committee addresses a particular matter involving

specific parties[4] or a particular matter of general applicability[5]. The financial interests

that must be reported include stocks, grants, consulting, teaching, speaking and writing

engagements, expert testimony, patents, and royalties. In addition, the financial interests

of a spouse, minor child, employer, officer, director, trustee, or partner are imputed to the

committee member.[6]

Likewise, FDA encourages OPH speakers to disclose financial relationships they may

have with the topic of the meeting and parties (e.g., sponsor and competitors of the

product(s) under discussion). At the commencement of each OPH session, the Chair of

the advisory committee meeting should read one of the statements set forth in III.A and

III.B below, addressing the issue of financial disclosure for all open public hearing

speakers.

**A.** **Instructive Statement for Particular Matters Involving Specific Parties**

**Meetings**

4 See 5 CFR 2640.102(l)
5 See 5 CFR 2640.102(m)
6 If a SGE or RGE has certain financial interests, he or she may not participate in the meeting unless granted a waiver
for conflict of interest, see 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) and (b)(3). The basis for granting a waiver will include, as appropriate,
the public health interest in having the expertise of the member with respect to a particular matter. 21 U.S.C. 379(d)-1.
When a member is granted a waiver, the financial interest(s) associated with the waiver are posted on FDA’s website
and read into the transcript of the meeting. See, “Guidance for the Public, FDA Advisory Committee Members, and
FDA Staff: Public Availability of Advisory Committee Members' Financial Interest Information and Waivers,”

##### Release of ORA Laboratory Analytical Results to the Responsible Party:
 Guidance for Food and Drug Administration Staff[1]


This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.


###### I.  Introduction

This document provides guidance for FDA staff regarding the release of final and, in some
circumstances, preliminary Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) laboratory analytical results to
the responsible party.[2] This policy applies to samples collected during FDA regulatory activities
and analyzed in ORA laboratories. It applies to FDA personnel assigned to deliver and discuss
ORA laboratory analytical results with the responsible party. The policy does not require the
responsible party to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the records.[3]

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidance describes the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

###### II. Background

Sample collection and analysis (which may include finished product and environmental samples)
are important tools the FDA uses to assess regulatory compliance of FDA-regulated products and
ensure public health protection. In general, the FDA does not release the results of any
regulatory testing it conducts until its ORA laboratory analytical results are final and the report is
completed, accepted by the responsible FDA official, and any protected information is

1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Strategic Planning and Operational Policy, in the Office of
Regulatory Affairs, in cooperation with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Veterinary
Medicine, the Center for Tobacco Products, and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
2 For purposes of this guidance, the term responsible party may include an owner, operator or agent in charge of the
site where the regulatory sample is collected, or who may otherwise be responsible for the safety of the product
sampled. In some circumstances, more than one responsible party may need to be contacted.
3 FDA may also share records, including ORA laboratory analytical results, with other entities including state and
local governments and other federal agencies in accordance with 21 C.F.R. Part 20, Subpart E.

appropriately redacted.[4] The FDA has processes in place for the release of final ORA laboratory
data and analytical results to the responsible party from which the samples are collected.[5,6]
However, because certain laboratory tests performed in ORA laboratories may take several
weeks to complete, it can be necessary for the Agency to share preliminary results with the
responsible party before the final results are confirmed.

This guidance provides a standardized policy on the release of final ORA laboratory analytical
results for FDA samples. The FDA will generally release such results when doing so would
advance public health goals. This guidance clarifies when and how such results could be
released. This document also describes the FDA’s policy to orally share, under some
circumstances, certain preliminary ORA laboratory analytical results (internally referred to as
“Cannot Rule Out” (CRO) results) with the responsible party.[7] A CRO result is a preliminary
indication that the sample may yield a final result that could present a public health hazard or
threat. A CRO result indicates that the laboratory analytical testing is ongoing, and final results
have not yet been determined.

Communicating a CRO result before the FDA confirms the final result is intended to provide the
responsible party with information to make informed decisions about potential hazards and
products on the market, as well as to consider initiating or preparing to initiate appropriate
mitigating strategies to address a potential hazard.

###### III. Policy

**A.** **Proactive release of CRO ORA laboratory analytical results**

1. In general, FDA should not share CRO results until testing is completed.

2. However, FDA may orally release CRO results to the responsible party after
clearance in accordance with ORA laboratory procedures if the FDA determines that
such release is in the interest of public health. FDA’s assessment and consideration
of when to release CRO results should include, but not be limited to:

a. The potential consequences of the injury or illness that could be caused by the
regulated product, if it is ultimately confirmed to contain a poisonous or
deleterious substance(s) or other hazardous substance, or otherwise deemed to
represent a public health threat;
b. Any background information on the danger associated with the poisonous or
deleterious substance(s) or other hazardous substance/situation related to the
sample under analysis;

4 _See 21 C.F.R. §§ 20.20(a), 20.105; 21 C.F.R. Part 20, Subpart D._
5 _See ORA-LAB,5.10 Reporting Laboratory Data,_
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ScienceResearch/FieldScience/LaboratoryManual/UCM092171.pdf
6 For the release of ORA food and food-related environmental laboratory analytical samples, see FMD 147
_Communication of Sample Analysis Results for Food Products and Environmental Samples,_
_https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/Inspections/FieldManagementDirectives/UCM449001.pdf_
7 Pursuant to 21 C.F.R.§§ 20.21, 20.105(c), when FDA discloses CRO results to the responsible party, the
information is immediately available for public disclosure to any member of the public who requests it.

c. Susceptibility of the consumers that could be affected;
d. The accuracy of the screening method; and
e. Whether release of the CRO results would interfere with an investigation or
enforcement proceeding.

3. FDA Centers and Offices that should be consulted before orally communicating CRO
results to the responsible party, include but are not limited to:

a. For-cause inspections:

i. For CRO results for samples collected as part of a for-cause inspection
(e.g., follow-up to a recall, patient death/injury, or consumer
complaint), ORA should collaborate with the respective Center to
coordinate strategy prior to communicating with the responsible party.

b. Outbreaks and emergencies:

i. For CRO results that are associated with a human or animal food or
cosmetic outbreak being coordinated by the FDA Coordinated
Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network (CORE), ORA should
collaborate with CORE, the respective Center, and Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), to coordinate strategy prior to
communicating with the responsible party.[8]
ii. For CRO results associated with other FDA-regulated products related
to a public health emergency, ORA should collaborate with the FDA’s
Office of Emergency Operations and the respective Center to
coordinate strategy prior to communicating with the responsible party.

c. Concerns about the sterility of products labeled “sterile:”

i. For CRO results associated with sterile injectable, inhalation, topical
or ophthalmic drug products, ORA should collaborate with the
respective Center or, if necessary, the Counter-Terrorism and
Emergency Coordination Staff to coordinate strategy prior to
communicating with the responsible party.
ii. For CRO results associated with sterile medical devices, ORA should
coordinate with the respective Center to coordinate strategy prior to
communicating with the responsible party.

d. Other situations associated with a public health risk:

i. When deemed appropriate by the ORA program director, and in
accordance with a strategy developed in collaboration with the
respective Center, CRO results may be communicated to the
responsible party.

8 State partners should also be included in communications with the responsible party, in accordance with ORA’s
Field Bulletin 61: Inviting State Partners on Calls with Firms to Explain CDC Epidemiological or Laboratory Data
During Outbreak Investigations.

## Page 24

4. Any release of CRO results should include the disclaimer statement below. When
results are communicated orally to the responsible party, the FDA official releasing
the CRO results should read the statement to the responsible party and document
doing so.

_Disclaimer: “Cannot rule out” sample results are preliminary in_
_nature. They are being shared at this time for informational purposes only._
_Although this information should be considered as one component of a larger_
_evaluation of product safety, the FDA’s communication of these preliminary_
_results does not imply that any future action by any government agency or_
_private party is necessary or appropriate. Final Office of Regulatory Affairs_
_(ORA) laboratory analytical results will be provided as soon as practicable_
_after they become available. However, you remain responsible for assuring_
_the quality and safety of all products you have released to the market. The_
_FDA is not responsible for the consequences of any private party’s decision to_
_act, or to not act, on the “cannot rule out” results. More information about_
_“cannot rule out” ORA laboratory results is available at [Provide link to this_
_guidance]._

**B.** **Release of final ORA laboratory analytical results**

Upon request by the responsible party (either received by FDA orally or in writing), the FDA
may, at its discretion or if mandated by law,[9] release final ORA laboratory analytical results
for samples that were collected during FDA regulatory activities. The final results may be
provided to the responsible party without the need to file a request that is formally designated
as a FOIA request. Releasing final ORA laboratory analytical results in this manner allows
the responsible party to take appropriate action, and/or resume normal operation based on the
results.

1. In situations where a responsible party is voluntarily holding product, or holding
product under the conditions set forth in the import entry bond, pending final ORA
laboratory analytical results, the FDA may orally notify the responsible party of the
final laboratory analytical results. Written notification may follow at FDA’s
discretion or if required by law. FDA personnel should document the details of the
notification discussion, as well as the responsible party’s response.

2. In limited cases, FDA may withhold the release of ORA laboratory analytical results,
e.g. if the release is reasonably expected to interfere with an investigation or
enforcement proceeding.

9 _See, e.g., section 704(d) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which requires that, “[w]henever in the_
course of any such inspection of a factory or other establishment where food is manufactured, processed, or packed,
the officer or employee making the inspection obtains a sample of any such food, and an analysis is made of such
sample for the purpose of ascertaining whether such food consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or
decomposed substance, or is otherwise unfit for food, a copy of the results of such analysis shall be furnished
_promptly to the owner, operator, or agent in charge.” (emphasis added)._

#### Product Recalls, Including Removals and Corrections

 Guidance for Industry

_This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on_
_this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You_
_can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations._
_To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the_
_title page._

###### I. Introduction:

This guidance document is intended to provide guidance and recommendations to FDAregulated industry regarding what information firms should give to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and how they should notify their customers about product recalls. This
guidance is intended to assist those members of industry regulated by the FDA in handling most
aspects of a product recall, as well as some removals and corrections which do not meet the
definition of a recall under 21 CFR 7.3. The guidance includes a checklist of documentation and
information that industry can provide to the FDA that will be used by FDA to evaluate, classify,
monitor and audit product recalls. Various statutory provisions and regulations, described below,
authorize the FDA to require recalls of certain products in particular circumstances. Additionally,
subpart C of part 7 of FDA regulations (21 CFR 7.40-59) provides general guidance for the
voluntary recall of products, including those recalls initiated by a firm on its own and at the
FDA's request. This guidance provides more specific recommendations and applies to voluntary
and, to the extent that the guidance does not conflict with statute or regulation, mandatory recalls
of all FDA-regulated products (i.e., food, including animal food; drugs, including animal drugs;
medical and radiological devices and products; cosmetics; tobacco products; and biological
products.)

Certain statutory provisions authorize mandatory recalls of infant formula (FD&C Act § 412(e)(g) [21 U.S.C. § 350a(e)-(g)]), medical devices (FD&C Act § 518(e) [21 U.S.C. § 360h(e)]),

## Page 28

food (FD&C Act § 423 [21 U.S.C. § 350l]), tobacco products (FD&C Act § 908(c) [21 U.S.C. §
387h(c)]), electronic products (FD&C Act § 535 [21 U.S.C. § 360ll]), controlled substances
(FD&C Act § 569D [21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-8d]), and biological products (Public Health Service
Act § 351(d) [42 U.S.C. § 262(d)]). Additionally, FDA regulations set forth specific
requirements for mandatory infant formula recalls (subpart E of 21 CFR part 107), medical
device corrections and removals (21 CFR part 806), mandatory device recalls (21 CFR part 810),
electronic product notifications and corrections (21 CFR parts 1003 and 1004) and mandatory
recalls for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (subpart F of 21 CFR part
1271). In addition to the requirements in these statutory provisions and regulations, the
guidance's specific recommendations may also be useful for these types of recalls. In the context
of a mandatory recall, those conditions in the guidance that are set forth in a statute and/or
regulation are requirements, rather than recommendations.

The FDA believes that expediting recall activities is vital . Recalling firms are urged to notify the
appropriate FDA Division Recall Coordinator (DRC) or Center contact as soon as a decision is
made that a recall is appropriate and, if feasible, prior to the issuance of a notice to the public or
written communications to customers. To locate your recall coordinator, please check the
[following website: https://www.fda.gov/safety/industry-guidance-recalls/ora-recall-coordinators.](https://www.fda.gov/safety/industry-guidance-recalls/ora-recall-coordinators)

After the decision to recall is made, we recommend that you establish communication with a
DRC or Center contact and submit the information outlined in this guidance to your FDA contact
as soon as possible. We also recommend that you submit information as it becomes available to
you rather than waiting until all applicable information is ready. This will allow the FDA the
opportunity to review and comment on your recall strategy and to offer guidance and assistance
in your recall process.

FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in FDA's guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

Additional recommended information for Drug recalls:

1 The recommendations in Section II do not apply to products regulated by FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research (CBER).  CBER has established the Direct Recall Classification program as the primary means by
which firms communicate with CBER regarding a recall. Further information on the Direct Recall Classification
program may be found at
[https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ReportaProblem/BiologicalProductDeviations/ucm](https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ReportaProblem/BiologicalProductDeviations/ucm172970.htm)
[172970.htm.](https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ReportaProblem/BiologicalProductDeviations/ucm172970.htm)
2 Some information is required to be reported for certain products, such as medical device corrections and removals
under 21 CFR 806.10. Firms should be familiar with mandatory reporting requirements specific to their product
even if they are not noted in this guidance.

## Page 34

          - federal government

          - foreign (specify whether they are wholesale distributors, retailers or users)

`o` Geographic areas of distribution, including foreign countries.

`o` A direct account list (name, address, city, state, contact name, phone number) to
the DRC. At minimum, the list should include the "ship to" addresses. If
available, provide a copy of this list in a sortable electronic spreadsheet format
(e.g., a Microsoft Excel file.) When feasible, you should include other relevant
fields in the spreadsheet that might help facilitate follow-up by FDA (e.g., lot
numbers, shipment dates) You should include any foreign customers and federal
government customers (e.g., USDA agencies, Department of Veterans Affairs,
Department of Defense).

          - Indicate what the list represents (i.e., all customers who were shipped
recalled product; all customers who were sold recalled product; all
customers who may have been shipped or sold recalled product because it
was sold to them within the applicable time period). Most FDA-regulated
products are subject to regulations that require distribution
recordkeeping.[3] To the fullest extent available or required, as applicable,
you should provide an exact distribution list (not a "may have" list) for the
recalled lot(s).

`o` Was product sold under a government contract? If yes, provide the contract
number, contract date and implementation date. If no, indicate so.

`o` Was product sold to any federal, state, or local agency involved in a school lunch
program? If yes, list the customers and provide the quantity sold, the sale date
and the shipment date.

In addition, we recommend that you notify both "ship to" and "bill to" customers of the recall so
that:

`o` "Ship to" customers can retrieve the product from their location.

3 For various requirements related to distribution recordkeeping see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.196 (human and animal
drugs); 21 CFR 820.160 (medical devices); 21 CFR 117.139 (human food) 21 CFR 111.475 (dietary supplements);
21 CFR 106.100(g) (infant formula); 21 CFR 113.100(f) (low acid foods); 21 CFR 114.100(d) (acidified foods); 21
CFR 507.38 (animal food); 21 CFR 226.110 (Type A medicated articles); 21 CFR 225.202 (medicated animal feed);
21 CFR 1270.35(c) (human tissue); 21 CFR 1271.265(e) (human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based
products); and 21 CFR 1.980(k) and 800.55(k) (post administrative detention recordkeeping).

## Page 35

`o` "Bill to" customers, if responsible, can initiate the sub-recall.[4]

10. RECALL STRATEGY. We recommend you provide the following:

`o` Indicate the level in the distribution chain to which you are extending the recall.
(e.g., wholesale, retail, pharmacy, or consumer/user, such as patient or physician)

          - If your recall only extends to the wholesale/distributor level, then we
recommend that you explain your rationale for not recalling to
retail/pharmacy/user level.

`o` Indicate the scope of the recall (i.e., which lots are affected). Indicate your
strategy for expanding the scope of the recall should additional lots be shown to
be affected.

`o` Indicate the method of recall communication (e.g., mail, phone, facsimile, email). We recommend that you include a written communication so customers
will have a record of the recall and your instructions.

`o` When your customers of the recalled lot(s) can be quickly determined with
accuracy and completeness (e.g., via distribution records), we recommend
directing recall communications to only those customers who received the
recalled lots. Although indiscriminately sending the notification to all customers
may be simpler, this practice desensitizes customers to recall notices, many of
whom receive hundreds of inapplicable recall notices per year. If used, indicate
how written communications will be sent to customers (e.g., e-mail, overnight
mail, first class mail, certified mail, facsimile).

`o` If initial communication is made by phone, provide a copy of the phone script.

`o` If you have a web site, consider posting the recall communication on the web site
as an additional method of customer notification about the recall. (Note: This is
not recommended as a sole means of customer notification.)

`o` Provide what you have instructed customers to do with the recalled product.

`o` Identify a recall contact for each customer and address recall communications to
those recall contacts to reduce the potential for the communication letter to get
misdirected.

4 Sub-recalls occur when a consignee further distributes a recalled product without changing the product. A subrecall is an action taken by that consignee to notify its own accounts.

11


-----

## Page 36

`o` If the product should be returned, refunded, or replaced, explain the mechanics of
such process.

`o` If this recall will create a market shortage that may impact consumers, explain the
situation and provide any draft plan to address the shortage.

`o` Describe your recall effectiveness check strategy. Include your strategy for how to
track and identify your customers who fail to respond to your recall
communications, and what additional steps you will take to notify non-responsive
customers.

`o` Determine and provide your course of action for out-of-business customers of the
recalled product.

`o` Provide a proposed method for destroying the recalled product, if applicable.

`o` If the product can be reconditioned (brought into compliance with the law),
explain how and where the reconditioning will take place. Please provide details
of the reconditioning plan to your FDA contact before implementation. All
reconditioning must be conducted under any applicable current good
manufacturing practices.

          - Describe how the recalled (i.e., pre-reconditioned) product will be
segregated and identified so it is not confused with reconditioned product.
Reconditioned product needs to be similarly distinguished from product
subject to recall that has not been reconditioned.

In addition, we recommend that:

`o` You contact your FDA DRC prior to product destruction. The FDA will review
your proposed method of destruction and may choose to witness the destruction.

`o` You and your customers keep adequate documentation of product destruction
(regardless of whether destruction was witnessed by an FDA investigator).

`o` Field corrections (e.g., product relabeling) be performed by recalling firm
representatives, or under their supervision and control. We do not recommend that
a disinterested party such as a wholesaler or retailer be responsible for field
corrections. For drug recalls: misbranded drugs for re-labeling should be returned
to the recalling firm.

`o` You contact your DRC prior to releasing reconditioned goods.

###### III. Recall Notice to Direct Account Consignees

1. [For guidance on issuing public warnings, please reference FDA's guidance on Public](https://www.fda.gov/media/110457/download)

[Warning and Notification of Recalls Under 21 CFR Part 7, Subpart C](https://www.fda.gov/media/110457/download) (issued in
February, 2019
[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/Recalls/IndustryGuidance/UCM592851.pdf)](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/Recalls/IndustryGuidance/UCM592851.pdf)

2. GUIDANCE FOR WRITTEN RECALL COMMUNICATIONS TO DIRECT
ACCOUNT CONSIGNEES: Recall communications should be flagged in large bold
print "URGENT: [insert "FOOD," "DRUG," "MEDICAL DEVICE," etc.]
**RECALL [or CORRECTION]." If used, envelopes should be similarly flagged. The**
terms "market withdrawal" or "stock recovery" should not be used because they have
separate regulatory definitions and do not accurately convey the definition of a recall.[5]
The FDA recommends that you include the following information in a written recall
communication to your direct account consignees:

a. PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION:

          - Include an accurate and complete description of the product and any codes
used to identify the product, e.g., lot/unit numbers, expiration date, serial
numbers, catalog numbers, model numbers, UDI, and UPC codes.

          - Consider including a copy of the product label with the recall
communication. This could be helpful in identifying and removing the
recalled product.

b. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:

          - Identify the reason for the recall and any potential health hazard(s)
associated with it. Ensure the statement is clear, directly conveys the risk,
and prompts an urgent response by the reader.

c. DEPTH OF THE RECALL:

          - The recall communication should clearly identify the depth to which the
recall is to extend (e.g., wholesale, retail, consumer or user level). For
example, if the recall is to the retail level, a statement should read "This
recall should be carried out to the retail level."

        - If the product could have been further distributed by your direct account
consignees to their customers, then you should include instructions to subrecall. Sub-recall instructions should also include a statement about the
depth of the recall, e.g., "If you have further distributed this product,

5 See 21 CFR 7.3(g), (h), (j), and (k) for the definitions of “recall,” “correction,” “market withdrawal,” and “stock
recovery,” respectively.

please identify your customers and notify them at once of this product
recall. This recall should be carried out to the retail level."

              - If your direct account consignees are instructed to conduct subrecalls, we recommend that you provide them with the date range
that the recalled product was distributed. Wholesalers/ distributors
may need this information to identify customers they shipped/sold
recalled product to.

              - If applicable, consider providing a sub-recall letter with your
communication package for your direct account consignees to
further notify their sub accounts. This better ensures that the
information provided to sub accounts is accurate and complete.

d. INSTRUCTIONS:

          - Your recall instructions to your direct account consignees should be clear.
For example:

              - Remove product from sale

              - Cease distribution

              - Sub-recall (if appropriate)

              - Return or correct product

          - Include a return response card/form. Your direct account consignees
should be asked to indicate whether they followed every instruction on the
return response card/form. Include a space for the consignee’s signature
and date.

We recommend that you provide examples of all recall communications (including letters,
attachments, envelope) to your DRC.

3. IMPORTANT: All customers in the distribution chain should be notified of the recall,
preferably in writing. Here are some examples of why this is important.

a. In the case of a human drug recall, the FDA does not believe it is appropriate
for a sales representative to visit a doctor's office and remove product without
notifying the physician or responsible staff of the recall. Physicians may be
treating patients that may suffer or have suffered some adverse effect from the
drug subject to recall. With knowledge of the recall and the reason for the recall,

14


-----

## Page 39

the physician can better evaluate a patient's condition and provide appropriate
patient care.

b. In the case of products sold at retail stores, the FDA does not believe it is
appropriate for a product salesperson or broker representative to remove product
from retail shelves without informing store management of the recall. Failure to
inform store management of the recall could result in product that is in storage, in
transit to the store, or returned by customers, being offered for sale at a later time.
The salesperson or broker representative may not have knowledge of or access to
the recalled products stored in back rooms. Recalled products that are in-transit to
the store could inadvertently be sold to customers. Recalled products returned by
customers could inadvertently be placed back on store shelves.

###### IV. Evaluation of the Recall

1. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RECALL:

You should ensure that your recall is effective. Therefore, we recommend that you consider
effectiveness checks for every recall. The purpose of an effectiveness check is to verify your
recall communication was received by your direct account consignee, and that they understood
and followed the recall instructions. The effectiveness check should also verify your recall
reached the appropriate level in the distribution chain.

Your effectiveness check is a means of evaluating the effectiveness of your recall. If your
effectiveness checks indicate that the recall communication was not received and/or its
instructions were not followed, then you should take steps to make the recall effective. These
steps may involve using alternative means of contacting your customers or sending out a follow
up communication that better identifies the product, better explains the problem and/or provides
better instructions to the consignees.

Note: In addition to reviewing the effectiveness checks conducted by a recalling firm, the FDA
may also contact a percentage of the firm’s customers (a process referred to as audit checks) as a
means of assessing whether the recalling firm and its customers are carrying out the recall. If
FDA's audit checks determine the recall to be ineffective, the recalling firm (or sub recalling firm
if such is the case) will then be requested by FDA to take appropriate actions, such as re-issuing
recall communications.

2. RECALL STATUS REPORTS:

You will be asked to provide Recall Status Reports to your DRC after initiating a recall (usually
on

15


-----

## Page 40

a monthly basis but more frequently when indicated). Your Recall Status Reports should usually
include the following information:

- Dates and method of customer notification

- Number of customers notified

- Number of customers that responded

- Quantity of recalled product returned or otherwise accounted for

- Number of customers that did not respond (FDA may ask for the identity of such customers)

- Estimated time frame for completion of the recall

- Details of your recall effectiveness checks

3. ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM THAT RESULTED IN THE RECALL:

It is important to attempt to establish the root cause of a problem that results in a product recall
so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken. We recommend that you provide the root
cause information to your DRC or appropriate Center contact.

4. CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS TO PREVENT FUTURE
OCCURRENCES OF THE PROBLEM:

We recommend that you explain to the FDA the corrective and preventive actions planned or
underway that will prevent a similar problem from recurring. You should provide this
information to your DRC or appropriate Center contact.

5. TERMINATION OF THE RECALL:

We recommend that you evaluate your recall for termination when all possible customer
responses have been received and it is reasonable to assume that the product subject to the recall
has been removed and proper disposition or correction has been made commensurate with the
degree of hazard of the recalled product. A final Recall Status Report and documentation of
recalled product disposition should be provided to your DRC, after which the FDA will consider
[formal termination of the recall action. See 21 CFR 7.55 Termination of a recall.](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=7.55)

Note: Upon receipt of termination information, the DRC may prepare a recall termination
document for center and/or division management concurrence. When concurrence is obtained,
the FDA division office will notify the recalling firm that the FDA considers the recall
terminated.

###### Guidance for the Public, FDA Advisory Committee Members, and FDA Staff: Public Availability of Advisory Committee Members' Financial Interest Information and Waivers[1]

_This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking_
_on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not_
_operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach_

**I. INTRODUCTION**

This guidance is intended to help the public, Food and Drug Administration

(FDA) advisory committee members, and FDA staff to understand and implement

statutory requirements and FDA policy regarding public availability of information about

financial interests and waivers[2] granted by FDA to permit individuals to participate in

advisory committee meetings subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5

U.S.C. App.). This guidance describes the basis and provides a format for public

disclosure of certain financial interests by special Government employees (SGEs) and

regular Government employees participating in these advisory committee meetings, and

provides a format for FDA waivers allowing participation in these meetings.[3] This

1 This guidance has been prepared by the Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff in the
Office of the Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration.
2 For purposes of this guidance, the term "waiver" refers to determinations and certifications that the
Agency is authorized to issue under 18 U.S.C. § 208(b)(1) and (b)(3), respectively.
3 _See “Guidance for the Public, FDA Advisory Committee Members, and FDA Staff on Procedures for_
Determining Conflict of Interest and Eligibility for Participation in FDA Advisory Committees,”
[http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122045.htm. That document describes FDA’s](http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122045.htm)
policy for considering whether an individual invited to participate in an FDA advisory committee meeting

guidance also explains how and when these documents will be made publicly available

by FDA.

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally

enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking

on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or

statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means

that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

**II. APPLICABILITY**

This guidance applies to SGEs and regular Government employees invited to

participate in FDA advisory committees subject to FACA. The types of advisory

committee meetings within the scope of this guidance are meetings involving particular

matters as defined in regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). See

5 CFR § 2640.103(a)(1).[4]

**III. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE**

Advisory committees provide independent, expert advice on scientific, technical,

and policy matters related to the development and evaluation of products regulated by

FDA, such as human and animal drugs, biological products, medical devices, foods,

cosmetics, and tobacco products. The advisory committee system enhances FDA’s

has a potential conflict of interest under 18 U.S.C. 208 and whether, under the statute, a waiver to allow
participation in an advisory committee meeting is appropriate.
4 Particular matters involve deliberation, decision, or action that is focused upon the interests of specific
persons or a discrete and identifiable class of persons, and include matters involving specific parties and
matters of general applicability. See also 5 CFR § 2640.102(l)-(m).

ability to protect and promote the public health and maintain the public trust by enabling

the agency to obtain the benefit of independent, professional expertise. Although

advisory committees provide recommendations to FDA, final decisions are made by

FDA. See 5 U.S.C. App. 2 § 9(b); 21 CFR § 14.5.

Most FDA advisory committee members are appointed as SGEs. Advisory

committee members may also be regular Government employees; for example, FDA may

request participation by employees of the United States Department of Agriculture, the

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or other Federal agencies for matters where

such employees’ expertise is needed.

FDA implements a rigorous process for soliciting and vetting candidates for

advisory committee meetings to minimize any potential for financial conflicts of interest.

In preparation for advisory committee meetings involving particular matters, SGEs

invited to participate in the meetings are required to report to FDA any financial interests

related to the subject matter of the advisory committee meeting. See 5 CFR §

2634.904(a)(2). Regular Government employees also report financial interests on a

yearly basis and/or just prior to the advisory committee meeting they are planning to

attend. See 5 CFR §§ 2634.202 and 2634.904(a)(1). FDA reviews these reports, called

Confidential Financial Disclosure Reports[5] in advance of each upcoming meeting, once

5 In rare cases, an individual who is a regular Government employee may file a Public Financial Disclosure
Report.

## Page 48

the meeting topics have been identified, to determine whether any financial conflicts of

interest may exist for these individuals.[6]

FDA seeks to identify all potential financial conflicts related to the particular

matter before a committee. FDA reviews not only the financial interests of a potential

advisory committee participant and his immediate family, but also the financial interests,

of which he has knowledge, of the participant's business partners, organizations for which

he serves as officer, director, trustee, general partner, or employee, and any prospective

employer of the member (if there are ongoing employment negotiations or an agreement

regarding future employment). See 18 U.S.C. § 208(a).

FDA is authorized by statute to grant waivers to allow individuals with potentially

conflicting financial interests to participate in meetings where it concludes, after close

scrutiny, that certain criteria are met. See 18 U.S.C. § 208(b)(1) and (b)(3). The Agency

has also issued a guidance document describing our policy for considering eligibility for

advisory committee participation.[7]

This document contains revisions to reflect the statutory changes in FDA’s

authority after the implementation of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and

Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA), and replaces previous guidance of the same title.[8]

6 In addition, FDA screens advisory committee members broadly for covered relationships that could
present even the appearance that they have conflicts of interest that could affect their impartiality. See 5
CFR § 2635.502. This guidance does not address this screening process.
7 _See FDA's "Guidance for The Public, FDA Advisory Committee Members, and FDA Staff on Procedures_
for Determining Conflict of Interest and Eligibility for Participation in FDA Advisory Committees"

8 Section 712 of the FD&C Act requires that FDA review its disclosure guidance at least every 5 years, and
update guidances as appropriate. This revision is a result of that review.

**IV. LEGAL FRAMEWORK**

Members of FDA’s advisory committees are subject to government wide conflict

of interest statutes and standards of ethical conduct regulations. A federal conflict of

interest statute, 18 U.S.C. § 208, prohibits an SGE or regular Government employee with

a financial interest that can be affected by the particular matter before the advisory

committee from participating in the advisory committee meeting unless a waiver is

granted or the financial interest is covered by one of the regulatory exemptions found at 5

CFR Part 2640. The statute is applicable government-wide, and specifies the

circumstances under which FDA may grant waivers to permit participation in specific

meetings. An additional statutory requirement applies to FDA advisory committees.

FDA is directed to disclose on its website the type, nature, and magnitude of the financial

interests of each advisory committee member who has received a waiver under 18 U.S.C.

§ 208 and the reasons for granting each waiver prior to the advisory committee meeting,

including, as appropriate, the public health interest in having the expertise of the member

with respect to the particular matter.[9] A waiver for an SGE must be based on a

determination that the need for the SGE’s service outweighs the potential for a conflict of

9 This statutory disclosure requirement has changed over time. For example, under § 505(n)(4) of the
FD&C Act, enacted as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of
1997, advisory committee members serving on panels related to new drugs could only receive a waiver of a
conflict of interest requirement “upon public disclosure of such conflict of interest if such waiver is
necessary to afford the panel essential expertise.” The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of
2007 repealed § 505(n)(4) and enacted § 712. As enacted at that time, § 712 also contained provisions
regarding waivers of conflicts of interests and public disclosures of such waivers. It had several differences
from § 505(n)(4), including that it extended its conflict of interest rules to all FDA advisory committee
members. In 2012, Congress enacted FDASIA, which amended § 712, including by removing the
“essential expertise” agency-specific waiver standard. The requirement to make disclosures of waivers is
now in § 712(c).

interest. This information must be published within specified time frames before

advisory committee meetings. See § 712(c) of the FD&C Act.

In addition to these statutory requirements regarding the disclosure of information

about financial interests and corresponding waivers, FDA also has the authority to

establish policies regarding the operation of advisory committees and participation of

advisory committee members. See 21 U.S.C. § 393; 41 CFR §§ 102-3.105 and 102
3.130.

**V. DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND WAIVERS**

To increase the transparency, consistency, and clarity of the advisory committee

process, consistent with the requirements of § 712(c) of the FD&C Act described above,

FDA has concluded that it is desirable to implement agency-wide procedures regarding

disclosure of financial interest information that apply to all SGE and regular Government

employees invited to participate in FDA advisory committee meetings subject to FACA.

In preparation for each advisory committee meeting, to ensure individuals understand

what information about their financial interests will be made public, FDA intends to

request that individuals within the scope of this guidance acknowledge that FDA intends

to publicly disclose the type, nature, and magnitude of any waived financial interests.

FDA further intends to make the individuals’ participation in advisory committee

meetings contingent upon their acknowledgement of FDA’s intention to publicly disclose

this information.

6


-----

## Page 51

To facilitate such disclosure, FDA plans to prepare a document listing the

financial interests for which a waiver is sought. A template that FDA intends to use

when preparing this document, based on information already submitted by the

individual,[10] is found in Appendix 1. Using the template format, FDA will list personal

and immediate family interests separately from other imputed interests. Other imputed

financial interests are those that are attributed to the individual through his employer (i.e.,

the employer has a relevant financial interest) or through his position as an officer,

director, trustee, or general partner. Even though the individual may have no personal

involvement in these interests, imputed financial interests that can be affected by the

particular matter before the advisory committee are considered conflicts of interest under

the applicable law.

First, FDA will identify the type of interest. The template provides several

examples, such as stocks/investments and employment. Second, FDA will identify the

nature of the interest. The template instructs that the name of the company or institution

be identified, along with indicating whether the firm is the sponsor, a competing firm, or

other affected entity. Third, FDA will indicate the magnitude of an interest by a dollar

range, such as $0 to 5000. The agency will request that the individual in need of a waiver

review the document and acknowledge his/her understanding that FDA will publicly

disclose the information.

FDA does not intend to publicly disclose financial interest information if the

information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act or

10 _See section III above._

## Page 52

otherwise protected from disclosure by statute or regulation, except if necessary to

describe the type, nature, and magnitude of the financial conflict being waived. For

example, FDA would not disclose the name of a company or institution in which the

committee member has a financial interest if doing so would reveal that company’s

confidential commercial information.

In addition, FDA is providing a template of the waivers that the agency grants

(Appendix 2). FDA intends to write the waivers in a manner to ensure that information

protected from disclosure by statute or regulation does not appear in the waivers. The

waivers would therefore not typically require redaction when publicly disclosed as

described in the following paragraph. However, if confidential information appears in

other documents submitted, completed, or generated in the course of FDA’s review of

financial interests and waiver requests, this information will continue to be protected

from public disclosure in accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory

requirements. See, e.g., 21 CFR Part 20.

For waivers that are granted, the disclosure statement will be posted on FDA’s

website, along with the agency’s waiver. FDA will post these documents on the FDA

website[11] at least 15 days prior to the relevant advisory committee meeting, except for

financial conflicts of interest that do not become known to FDA until shortly before the

meeting. For conflicts of interest that FDA becomes aware of less than 30 days prior to

the meeting and for which a waiver is issued, FDA will post the documents as soon as

practicable and no later than the day of the meeting. These time frames are consistent

with the requirements of section 712(c) of the FD&C Act. The agency also plans to

make the disclosure statements and waiver documents public at corresponding advisory

committee meetings.

Additionally, FDA plans to post a roster[12] of all advisory committee members

expected to attend a specific meeting at the same time briefing materials for that meeting

are posted. See FDA’s Guidance for Industry: Advisory Committee Meetings –

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking on this
topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact
the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate
FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

This document provides guidance to industry sponsors, applicants, and petitioners
(referred to collectively as sponsors) who develop, prepare, or submit briefing materials
that will be given to advisory committee members as background information before an
open FDA advisory committee meeting.[2] This guidance will help sponsors develop,
organize, and submit advisory committee briefing materials for public release and should
help minimize the time and resources spent in preparing these materials for public
availability. The guidance also describes the process FDA intends to follow when we
make briefing materials available to the public. In addition, the Appendices provide
recommended timelines for preparing and submitting briefing materials to us.[3]

An important goal of this guidance is to help ensure that briefing materials are made
available to the public as provided under section 10(b) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App. 2). The guidance includes recommendations on

1 This guidance has been prepared by a working group with members from across FDA.

2 Most FDA advisory committee meetings are open to the public. However, sometimes a portion of a
meeting will be closed to the public under 21 C.F.R. § 14.27. This guidance only applies to briefing
materials prepared for open advisory committee meetings or for the open portions of such meetings.

3 This guidance, which applies to all FDA open advisory committee meetings or open portions of such
meetings, replaces three previously issued draft guidances: 1) "Guidance for Industry: Disclosing
Information Provided to Advisory Committees in Connection with Open Advisory Committee Meetings
Related to the Testing or Approval of New Drugs and Convened by the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, Beginning on January 1, 2000" (dated December 1999); 2) "Guidance for Industry: Disclosing
Information Provided to Advisory Committees in Connection with Open Advisory Committee Meetings
Related to the Testing or Approval of Biologic Products and Convened by the Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research" (dated February 2001); and 3) "Availability of Information Given to Advisory
Committee Members in Connection with CDRH Open Public Panel Meetings; Draft Guidance for Industry
and FDA Staff" (dated July 18, 2001).

how to identify information that is exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. § 552).

Our guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead,
guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as
recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use
of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended,
but not required.

**II.** **BACKGROUND**

**A.** **Relevant Statutes and Regulations**

As stated earlier, under section 10(b) of FACA, any materials made available to an
advisory committee also must be made available to the public. The public availability of
these materials, however, is subject to FOIA, and FOIA exempts certain types of
information from public disclosure. We interpret FACA to require that, with respect to
any open advisory committee meeting convened pursuant to FACA, whenever
practicable and subject to any applicable FOIA exemptions, those materials that we
provide to advisory committee members in connection with that meeting must be made
available for public inspection and copying before or at the time of the advisory
committee meeting.

Several FDA regulations (e.g., 21 CFR §§ 20.61, 20.63, 171.1, 314.430, 514.12, 601.51,
and 860.5) protect information that is exempt from public disclosure under FOIA. We
interpret our regulations to be consistent with FACA and intend to exercise our discretion
under our regulations in a manner consistent with FACA and FOIA. This guidance
should help ensure that information that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA will not
be made publicly available.

**B.** **Advisory Committee Meetings – General Information**
**III.**
We convene advisory committee meetings for a variety of different purposes. Some
meetings discuss particular matters such as the approval or testing of products. Topics
commonly discussed at this type of advisory committee meeting often involve marketing
applications/submissions such as:

     - New drug applications and application supplements;

     - New animal drug applications and application supplements;

     - Biologics license applications and application supplements;

     - Premarket approval applications for medical devices and their supplements;

     - Premarket notifications for medical devices; and

     - Medical device classifications and reclassifications.


-----

## Page 62

We also convene advisory committee meetings to discuss general matters, such as
guidance documents, issues pertaining to trial design, post-approval monitoring, citizen’s
petitions, and policy issues related to FDA-regulated products.

**III.** **MAKING BRIEFING MATERIALS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC**

**A.** **Scope of Briefing Materials Subject to this Guidance**

This guidance uses the term “briefing materials” to describe the package of information
that we provide to advisory committee members before a meeting. The briefing materials
usually contain information prepared by us and/or the sponsor (if the meeting involves an
application or a particular product). Although interested persons (i.e., individuals or
organizations who are not sponsors) may submit information to an advisory committee
pursuant to 21 C.F.R. §§ 14.29 or 14.35(d), this guidance does not consider those
submissions to be “briefing materials.”[4]

**B.** **Timelines for Submitting and Making Briefing Materials Publicly**
**Available**

For an open advisory committee meeting for which the briefing materials may contain
information that, under certain circumstances, could be considered to be exempt from
public disclosure under FOIA, we intend (as set forth in the Appendices) to post a
publicly available version of the briefing materials on our Web site no later than two full
**_business days[5]_** before the day the advisory committee meeting (or the part of the meeting
to which the materials pertain) is scheduled to occur.

With respect to meetings for which the briefing materials do not contain information that,
under certain circumstances, could be considered exempt from public disclosure under
FOIA, we will try to make the briefing materials available on our Web site more than two
full business days before the day the advisory committee meeting (or the part of the
meeting to which the materials pertain) is scheduled to occur. We anticipate that
meetings subject to this timeline will normally address general matters such as guidance
documents and policy issues related to FDA-regulated products.

Even when a sponsor states that its briefing materials are fully releasable (as described in
section IV.D.), we intend to post the briefing materials in accordance with the timelines
in the Appendices if the briefing materials contain the type of information that, under
certain circumstances, could be considered to be exempt from public disclosure under
FOIA. Please note that, as described in the Appendices, we intend to post both sponsor
4 Information submitted by interested persons is considered to be publicly disclosable and must conform to
the requirements of 21 CFR § 10.20. Failure to comply with the requirements will result in rejection of the
submission for filing or, if it is filed, in exclusion from consideration of any portion that fails to comply (21
CFR § 10.20(c)(6)).
5 In this guidance, a “business day” is a day that we are officially open for business.

prepared and agency-prepared briefing materials for a particular advisory committee
meeting (or part of a meeting) at the same time.

If an advisory committee meeting is scheduled to address more than one topic, separate
briefing materials may be prepared for the different topics on the meeting agenda. For
meetings that last more than one day, we intend to post the publicly available version of
the briefing materials on our Web site no later than two full business days before the
topic to which the materials pertain will be discussed. For example, assume that two
drugs, A and B, will be discussed on days 1 and 2 respectively. We would make the
briefing materials on drug A available no later than two full business days before the
scheduled day 1 of the advisory committee meeting and the briefing materials on drug B
available no later than two full business days before the scheduled day 2 of the advisory
committee meeting. Please note that the timelines for sponsors to submit materials to us
are linked to the first day of the meeting and not to the specific day on which a particular
topic will be discussed. Thus, in our example, the sponsor for drug B would have the
same deadline for submitting materials to us as the sponsor for drug A, even though the
discussions for their drugs (and the posting of their briefing materials) would occur on
different days.

The Appendices to this guidance provide timelines for preparing and submitting briefing
materials to us. Appendix A provides timelines for FDA-prepared briefing materials and
sponsor-prepared briefing materials in those instances where the sponsor states that its
materials are fully releasable to the public. Appendix B provides timelines for briefing
materials in instances where the sponsor asserts that its materials are not fully releasable.
Please note that the timelines in the Appendices do not provide for formal predisclosure
notification to sponsors pursuant to 21 CFR § 20.61(e) and (f). The predisclosure
notification requirements in that regulation apply only where the disclosure is to be made
in response to a specific request for our records. The disclosures contemplated here are
not made in response to a request for our records, but to comply with FACA.
Nevertheless, the timelines in the Appendices are at least as generous as the timeframes
for notification under 21 CFR § 20.61.

This guidance does, however, constitute public notice under 21 CFR §14.35(d)(2) that a
sponsor should submit information to us within the timelines listed in the Appendices if
the sponsor wants the advisory committee to consider that information before the
meeting. If we do not receive a sponsor’s briefing materials within the applicable
timeline in the Appendices, we do not intend to provide the sponsor’s briefing materials
to the members of the committee, and the committee will not consider the sponsor’s
materials before the meeting.

**C.** **Postponing the Public Release of Briefing Materials**

On occasion, the issue of whether certain information in the briefing materials should be
made available to the public may need to be decided in court. If a federal court directs us
to not release information in briefing materials, we will not release that information and


-----

## Page 64

may postpone the advisory committee meeting where the information would have been
discussed until the matter is resolved.

**IV.** **PREPARING BRIEFING MATERIALS**

The contents of the briefing materials provided to advisory committee members for their
review in advance of a meeting differ from meeting to meeting, and the type and amount
of information included generally will depend on the type of product or issues to be
discussed. Additionally, as indicated in the Appendices, the times by which sponsors
should submit briefing materials differ depending on whether the materials contain
information that the sponsor claims is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

It is important to minimize the time we will need to spend reviewing briefing materials,
consulting with sponsors, and redacting such materials. The more time we need to
complete this process, the earlier the sponsors may need to submit materials for an
advisory committee meeting. If the preparation of the materials occurs too far in advance
of a meeting, the materials may not adequately address the issues that will be the subject
of the meeting because those issues will not yet have been fully identified.

**A.** **General Recommendations on Preparing Briefing Materials**

For open advisory committee meetings that involve sponsor-prepared briefing materials,
approximately 55 business days before the meeting is scheduled to occur, FDA intends to
notify a sponsor that an advisory committee will consider an issue that is directly relevant
to the sponsor. We will explain the meeting’s focus to the sponsor and also may advise
the sponsor about the information it may wish to include in its briefing materials. To
facilitate the review and eventual posting of sponsor-prepared briefing materials, we
strongly recommend that sponsors submit both paper and electronic versions of their
materials. Sponsors should consult the appropriate FDA component about compatible
electronic formats and consult the Designated Federal Official[6] for a given meeting to
determine the appropriate number of paper copies.[7]

We emphasize that a sponsor’s submissions should include only information related to
the issue being discussed by the committee. Statements or suggestions that could be
viewed as misleading or promotional (e.g., statements that go beyond study conclusions
or speculate about clinical or commercial implications not supported by the data) are
inappropriate for inclusion in the briefing materials. In addition, statements or language
that are defamatory, irrelevant, or intemperate are inappropriate for inclusion in briefing
materials and should be avoided.

6 The Designated Federal Official is a federal employee who is responsible for the overall administrative
management of an advisory committee.
7 If an advisory committee meeting involves advisory committees from different agency components (e.g.,
a joint meeting of a Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research advisory committee and a Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research advisory committee), sponsors should consult the relevant Designated
Federal Officials of the two committees as to the Designated Federal Official coordinating the briefing
material process.

**B.** **Information in Briefing Materials That Typically Will Be Disclosable**
**Under FOIA**

We generally will consider the following information in advisory committee briefing
materials to be disclosable without redaction, unless the sponsor demonstrates that
disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial competitive harm:

    - Summaries of clinical safety and effectiveness data;

    - Summaries of non-clinical safety and effectiveness data;

    - Summaries of adverse drug reaction data;

    - Written discussion or analysis of safety or effectiveness data relevant to the

topic of the meeting;

    - A general description (such as that which would typically be included in

product labeling) of product functions, mechanics, and/or engineering;

    - A general description of physical characteristics and performance parameters;

    - Clinical or preclinical protocols or summaries of protocols;

    - Statistical protocols and analyses;

    - Information that is proposed to be included in product labeling, such as

indications and usage, dosage and administration, and safety information such

as warnings and precautions;

    - Literature references;[8]

    - Any other information that has been previously publicly disclosed by the

sponsor;

    - Copies of the sponsor’s slides to be presented at the advisory committee

meeting, if included in the briefing materials; and

    - Guidance documents.

The above list is neither exhaustive nor absolute.

With regard to certain topics discussed at advisory committee meetings (for example,
issues relating to the approval of a pending New Drug Application (NDA), Biologics
Licensing Application (BLA), Premarket Approval Application (PMA), 510(k), New

8 FDA does not post copyrighted materials on its Web site. If sponsors do wish to submit copyrighted
materials, they should provide a bibliography of the copyrighted materials that can be posted.

## Page 66

Animal Drug Application (NADA), or a supplement to any of these), some of the
information listed above might be considered confidential commercial information at
earlier stages of the product development process. However, we believe it is appropriate
to make this information available under 21 CFR §§ 20.82, 314.430(d)(1), 514.11(d),
601.51(d)(1), 814.9(d)(1), and/or 171.1(h)(2) (whichever is applicable) at the time of an
advisory committee meeting if the information is germane to the issues to be discussed at
the meeting. These materials are often necessary to a committee’s consideration of the
safety and effectiveness of a product being discussed and committees and sponsors
routinely discuss such matters at open advisory committee meetings. It is widely
understood that, when advisory committees consider such products, the information
contained in these materials will be the subject of open discussion.

**C.** **Information in Briefing Materials That Will Typically Be Exempt from**
**Disclosure**

We generally will consider the following types of information to be exempt from
disclosure under FOIA:

  - Information about product functions, mechanics, engineering, and schematic
drawings not in the proposed labeling and not within the scope of the agenda for
the meeting;

  - Proprietary physical characteristics and performance parameters not in the
proposed labeling and not within the scope of the agenda for the meeting;

  - Manufacturing process information;

  - Manufacturing quality control information;

  - Clinical raw data;[ 9]

  - Non-clinical raw data;

  - Supplier names, customer lists, production costs, inventory information, failure
rates of products, production quality control information;

  - Information for which the release would constitute an unwarranted invasion of
personal privacy; and

  - Product formulation information not in the labeling.

The above list is neither exhaustive nor absolute.

The advisory committee members will receive complete copies of the briefing materials,
including information that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. However, we will not
include information that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA in the publicly available

9
For the purposes of this guidance, FDA considers "raw data" to be a complete data set of case report
forms, case report tabulations, or line listings. Data that summarize individual or multiple subject outcomes
or results are considered summaries. Summaries may include examples of specific findings.

## Page 67

version of the briefing materials, and we will notify the committee members in writing
that any such exempt information may not be discussed during any open portion of the
advisory committee meeting.

**D.** **Fully Releasable Sponsor Briefing Materials**

To shorten the process for complying with FACA's disclosure requirements, we strongly
encourage sponsors to submit briefing materials that may be released to the public, in
accordance with the timelines in Appendix A, in their entirety without redaction (i.e., that
do not contain any information that the sponsor asserts is exempt from disclosure under
FOIA). Sponsors also benefit from preparing fully releasable briefing materials because
such briefing materials eliminate the need for us to redact trade secret and/or confidential
commercial information and, as a result, can be submitted to us closer in time to the
advisory committee meeting than briefing materials containing information that the
sponsor asserts is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. As a result, sponsors may be able
to devote more time to preparing their submissions before the advisory committee
meeting occurs (see timelines in the Appendices).

If a sponsor chooses to submit fully releasable briefing materials that it agrees can be
posted in accordance with the timeline in Appendix A, it should mark the materials as:
_“Advisory Committee Briefing Materials: Available for Public Release.”_

When we receive briefing materials marked as fully releasable, we will review the
materials for completeness. We will assume that sponsors who mark their materials
“Available for Public Release” have carefully reviewed the included materials to make
sure that they all may be made available to the public without redaction. Sponsors should
not expect us to identify trade secret or confidential commercial information in briefing
materials marked as “Available for Public Release.” We will, however, review sponsor
briefing materials for information that, if publicly released, would constitute a clearly
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and we will redact such information. This
review time is reflected in the timeline in Appendix A. Additionally, as stated in section
III.B., and as set forth in Appendix A, FDA intends to post both the sponsor-prepared
briefing materials and the agency-prepared briefing materials at the same time. As
discussed in section IV.F., and as set forth in Appendix A, the various activities relating
to our briefing materials will not have been completed at the time the sponsor submits
briefing materials that it indicates are fully releasable.

**E.** **Sponsor Briefing Materials that Contain Information Claimed to be**
**Exempt from Disclosure**

A sponsor may elect to prepare advisory committee briefing materials that contain
information that it believes is exempt from disclosure under FOIA (see section IV.C. for
a discussion of what types of information we generally will consider to be exempt from
disclosure). If the sponsor chooses to prepare such briefing materials, it should prepare
two versions of its briefing materials at the same time. One version should be complete,


-----

## Page 68

and should include the information that the sponsor believes should not be available for
public release. The second version should be a publicly releasable version.

We recommend that, when preparing briefing materials that contain information the
sponsor believes is exempt from disclosure, the sponsor should segregate the information
it believes is exempt from disclosure from the releasable information (e.g., by placing it
in a separate portion of the briefing materials) or clearly identify the specific information
that it believes is exempt from disclosure.

The complete version of the briefing materials (that is, the one that would not be
available for public release because it includes the information the sponsor believes is
exempt from disclosure under FOIA) should be clearly marked as: “Draft: Advisory
_Committee Briefing Materials: Not for Public Release: Contains Trade Secret and/or_
_Confidential Commercial Information.”_

For the version of the briefing materials that would be publicly releasable, the sponsor
should prepare and submit a copy of the same materials as are included in the version that
is not for public release, but this version should indicate what information the sponsor
believes is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Sponsors should indicate the
information they believe is exempt by providing a redacted copy. We suggest that, when
redacting information, sponsors should identify any proposed deletions and indicate
exactly how much material should be redacted. Sponsors can indicate the amount of
information that has been removed in several ways. For example, a sponsor could
include a statement such as “two paragraphs have been deleted,” or “five pages have been
removed.” For each document or portion of a document that the sponsor believes is
exempt from disclosure under FOIA, the sponsor should explain, in detail, why it
believes that the information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. We caution that, to
the extent that the sponsor intends to discuss specific information during the open portion
of the meeting, it will be difficult for the sponsor to claim that the information is exempt
from disclosure under FOIA.

Sponsors should label the redacted copy prominently as: “Draft: Advisory Committee
_Briefing Materials: Available for Public Release.”_

After we receive the two versions of the briefing materials (the non-public and publicly
releasable versions), we will review the briefing materials for completeness and
determine if the sponsor appropriately identified exempt information. If we disagree that
any of the information the sponsor has redacted is exempt from disclosure under FOIA,
we will discuss the matter with the sponsor. When the discussions are concluded, we will
notify the sponsor of our final decision. Once we have notified the sponsor of our final
decision, no new documents or information may be added to the briefing materials. See
the Appendices for details on the timing of this process.

When the sponsor receives our final decision regarding what information, if any, we have
determined to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA, the sponsor has four options:


-----

## Page 69

    - Option 1: The sponsor may remove from the briefing materials information
that we have determined is not exempt from disclosure under FOIA and thus
would not be redacted from the materials. The sponsor may reformat the
materials accordingly.

    - Option 2: If the sponsor accepts our determination as to the releasability of
the information in the briefing materials, and there is still information in the
materials that we and the sponsor agree is exempt from disclosure, the sponsor
should submit a final copy of both versions of the briefing materials. The
final documents should be prominently labeled: “Final: Advisory Committee
_Briefing Materials: Not for Public Release: Contains Trade Secret and/or_
_Confidential Commercial Information” and “Final: Advisory Committee_
_Briefing Materials: Available for Public Release.”_

    - Option 3: If we and the sponsor agree that no information in the materials is
exempt from disclosure under FOIA, then the sponsor should submit a copy
marked "Final: Advisory Committee Briefing Materials: Available for Public
_Release.”_

    - Option 4: If the sponsor disagrees with our determination regarding the
releasability of information in the briefing materials, the sponsor may seek
judicial review in federal court to prevent us from releasing the information.
If the sponsor chooses this option, we will not release the information that is
in dispute and may postpone the advisory committee meeting where the
information would be discussed until the matter is resolved.

When this process is complete, we will send the final version of the sponsor-prepared
briefing materials to the advisory committee members in preparation for the scheduled
meeting. We will identify for the advisory committee members any information in the
materials that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, and we will advise them that such
exempt information may not be discussed during any open portion of the advisory
committee meeting. Additionally, if during this process the sponsor has asserted, and
FDA has agreed, that certain information in the briefing materials is exempt from
disclosure under FOIA, the sponsor should not in turn discuss that information at an open
portion of the advisory committee meeting; such public discussion would be inconsistent
with the sponsor's assertions regarding the nonpublic status of the information.

**F.** **FDA-Prepared Advisory Committee Briefing Materials**

For most advisory committee meetings, we prepare our own briefing materials and send
them to the advisory committee members. When we have prepared our briefing
materials, we will review them to determine if they contain information that, under
certain circumstances, could be considered to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA
(specifically, confidential commercial or trade secret information belonging to a sponsor).
If the materials do not contain information that, under certain circumstances, could be
considered to be confidential commercial or trade secret information belonging to a


-----

## Page 70

sponsor, the portions of the timelines (see Appendices) that pertain to sharing our briefing
materials with sponsors will not apply. As discussed in section III.B., under such
circumstances we will try to post such briefing materials on our Web site more than two
full business days before the day the advisory committee meeting (or the portion of it to
which the briefing materials pertain) is scheduled to occur.

If we determine that our briefing materials contain information that, under certain
circumstances, could be considered to be confidential commercial or trade secret
information belonging to a sponsor, the portions of timelines in the Appendices
pertaining to sharing our briefing materials with sponsors will apply, and we will send
our briefing materials to the sponsor as described in the timelines. If the briefing
materials include information pertaining to more than one sponsor, we will send only the
relevant portion to each sponsor. We will discuss with each sponsor any disagreements it
may have about the disclosability of information in the materials. We note that, in
circumstances where the sponsor has submitted briefing materials that it has asserted are
not fully releasable, we may already have had discussions with the sponsor regarding the
releasability of certain information in the sponsor's briefing materials and have informed
the sponsor of our final decision regarding the redaction of information from its briefing
materials. Thus, our discussion with the sponsor regarding our briefing materials should
focus on new issues and information, and not on issues or information that were
previously discussed with the sponsor in the context of the sponsor's briefing materials.

When the discussions of our briefing materials are concluded, we will notify each
sponsor of our final decision regarding the public availability of the information in our
briefing materials. If the sponsor disagrees with our determination regarding the
releasability of information in our briefing materials, the sponsor may seek judicial
review in federal court to prevent us from releasing the information. If the sponsor
chooses this option, we will not release the information that is in dispute and may
postpone the advisory committee meeting where the information would be discussed until
the matter is resolved.

**G.** **Posting Briefing Materials on FDA’s Web Site**

We will post the briefing materials for an open advisory committee meeting subject to
this guidance on our Web site at [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/acwhatsnew.htm.](http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/acwhatsnew.htm)
The materials also will be available in hard copy at our Division of Dockets
Management’s Public Reading Room.[10] We will post only the publicly available
sponsor-prepared briefing materials and the publicly available FDA-prepared briefing
materials on our Web site.

To avoid any misunderstanding that we have endorsed the contents of a sponsor’s
briefing materials by posting them on our Web site, we will display the following
statement with the sponsor’s briefing materials placed on our Web site:

10 The Public Reading Room is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The Public Reading
Room is located at 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, Rockville, Maryland 20857.

We also may take appropriate action to address any information that may be promotional
or misleading, including posting a correction on our Web site.

Please note that if unforeseen difficulties prevent us from posting the briefing materials
on our Web site before an advisory committee meeting, we will make hard copies
available to the public at the time of the advisory committee meeting.

##### Lead in Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied Cosmetics: Recommended Maximum Level[1]
 Guidance for Industry 

This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA or we) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is
not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach,
contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

###### I. Introduction

This guidance provides a recommended maximum level of 10 parts per million (ppm) for lead as
an impurity in cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics that are marketed in the
United States. FDA (or “we”) has concluded that a recommended maximum level of 10 ppm for
lead as an impurity in cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics would not pose a
health risk. We consider the recommended maximum lead level to be achievable with the use of
good manufacturing practices and to be consistent with the 10 ppm maximum lead level for
similar products recommended by other countries. For additional discussion of the scientific and
legal background and rationale underlying this recommended level, see “Supporting Document
for Recommended Maximum Lead Level in Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied
[Cosmetics” (http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocuments/ucm517327.htm).](http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocuments/ucm517327.htm)

The issuance of this guidance supports our effort to limit human exposure to lead in finished
FDA-regulated cosmetic products by educating new manufacturers who wish to enter the market
and encouraging current manufacturers to continue to follow or improve on voluntary good
manufacturing practices that limit trace amounts of lead as an impurity. This guidance applies to
cosmetic lip products (such as lipsticks, lip glosses, and lip liners) and externally applied
cosmetics (such as eye shadows, blushes, shampoos, and body lotions) marketed in the United
States.[2] This guidance does not apply to topically applied products that are classified as drugs or
to hair dyes that contain lead acetate as an ingredient.

1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Cosmetics and Colors in the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
2 Cosmetic lip products are applied to the mucous membrane and therefore are not considered externally applied
cosmetics (See 21 CFR 70.3(v)).

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

###### II. Background

We regulate cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and Fair
Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). These laws require that cosmetics marketed in the United
States be safe under their intended and customary conditions of use, and be properly labeled.
Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by FDA. However, pre-market approval is
required for the color additives used as ingredients in cosmetics.

Although we have not set limits for lead as an impurity in cosmetics, most listed color additives
have specifications for lead as an impurity as part of our requirements for their safe use. This
guidance supports our effort to limit human exposure to lead in finished products by
recommending a maximum level of 10 ppm lead as an impurity in cosmetic lip products and
externally applied cosmetics.

The International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation and regions such as Canada and the
European Union have set a limit of 10 ppm for lead as an impurity in cosmetics based on
considerations of a reasonably achievable level, scientific risk assessment, good manufacturing
practices, technical feasibility, and appropriate analytical methods (Refs. 1, 2). This guidance is
consistent with those efforts.

###### III. Discussion

**A. Recommended Maximum Lead Level in Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied**
**Cosmetics**

Between 2007 and 2009, FDA scientists developed and validated a total dissolution method for
analyzing lead in lipstick and used this method to determine the lead content in a selection of 20
commercially available lipsticks on the U.S. market (Ref. 3). In 2010, using the same analytical
method, we obtained results for lead content in 400 lipsticks and other cosmetic lip products
available in the U.S., and in 2012, obtained similar results for an additional 30 cosmetic lip
products (Refs. 4, 5, 6, 7). Finally, between 2012 and 2013, we used a more common extraction
method for determining lead in an additional 29 cosmetic lip products (Ref. 7). The lead levels
found in our surveys ranged from 0.026 ppm (the detection limit of the total dissolution method
for the studies) to a maximum of 7.19 ppm in one lipstick. The average lead concentration was
1.09 ppm.

Between 2011 and 2012, we used a total dissolution method to obtain results for lead content in
120 externally applied cosmetic products available on the U.S. market, which included eye
shadows, blushes, body lotions, mascaras, foundations, body powders, compact powders,


-----

## Page 81

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

shaving creams, and face paints (Refs. 6, 7). Between 2012 and 2013, we used the extraction
method for determining lead in an additional 86 externally applied cosmetics (Ref. 7). The lead
levels found in our surveys ranged from 0.0084 ppm (the detection limit of the total dissolution
method for these studies) to a maximum of 14 ppm in one eye shadow and one blush. The
average lead concentration ranged from below the detection limit in shaving creams to 4.6 ppm
in compact powders.

These surveys indicate that levels of lead in the cosmetic lip products and externally applied
cosmetics we have sampled are for the most part well below 10 ppm, leading us to expect that
this recommended maximum level is achievable by all manufacturers of these products.
However, in our surveys, which do not necessarily reflect the full range of products that are
currently on the market, a small number of samples had lead levels that exceed the maximum
level we are recommending. Our goal is to ensure that cosmetic lip products and externally
applied cosmetics do not contain lead as an impurity at levels that would pose a health risk. We
have determined that a maximum level of 10 ppm in cosmetic lip products and externally applied
cosmetics would not pose a health risk, but we encourage manufacturers of these products to
follow or continue to follow manufacturing practices that allow them to achieve levels of lead
lower than 10 ppm whenever feasible.

We have concluded that a maximum level of 10 ppm for lead as an impurity in cosmetic lip
products and externally applied cosmetics should be readily achievable by manufacturers that
source their ingredients appropriately and use good manufacturing practices. Modern analytical
capability permits determination of lead at ppm levels, thus enabling manufacturers to avoid the
purchase of ingredients with unacceptably high levels of lead and to determine whether lead is
introduced into their products during the manufacturing process.

**B. Exposure Assessment and Public Health Impact of Recommended Maximum Lead Level**
**in Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied Cosmetics**

As explained in more detail in our supporting document, the routes of exposure to lead from
cosmetic lip products are incidental ingestion and dermal absorption and the route of exposure to
lead from externally applied cosmetics is dermal absorption. To assess the exposure to lead from
cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetic products, we assumed these products
contain 10 ppm lead because, as noted above, that impurity level should be readily achievable by
manufacturers. Additionally, 10 ppm lead is consistent with the 10 ppm maximum lead level for
similar products recommended by the International Cooperation on Cosmetics Regulation and
regions such as Canada and the European Union.

**1. Exposure to Lead from Cosmetic Lip Products**

The composition of cosmetic lip products limits the ability for lead present as an impurity to
diffuse from a product and be absorbed by the skin. Therefore, dermal absorption of lead from
cosmetic lip products is negligible, and we have concluded that systemic exposure to lead from
these products is primarily by incidental ingestion.


-----

## Page 82

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

We used an approach previously employed by FDA for estimating exposure to lead from food to
estimate exposure to lead from cosmetic lip products (Ref. 8). We estimated that maximum
exposure to 10 ppm lead from a cosmetic lip product is 0.24 µg/day for adults and adolescents
age 13 years or older and 0.024 µg/day for children age 12 years or younger (assuming that
children age 12 years or younger use 10% as much of these products as adults) (Ref. 9). We
determined that the potential elevation of blood lead levels from 10 ppm lead in these products is
too small to be measured in routine blood analysis and requires state of the art analytical
technology (Ref. 10).

**2. Exposure to Lead from Externally Applied Cosmetics**

Dermal absorption of lead from externally applied cosmetics is very small. Results for lead
uptake by the skin were reported for four lead compounds that resemble cosmetic ingredients
(Ref. 11). Based on those data, we estimated that only a very small amount (0.41%) of the lead
present as an impurity in an externally applied cosmetic is absorbed by the skin.

The amount of exposure to lead as an impurity in externally applied cosmetics depends on
whether the product is a “leave-on” product (such as eye shadow or body lotion) or a “rinse-off”
product (such as shampoo or shaving cream). The amount of exposure also depends on how
much product is applied to the skin. For example, eye shadows are applied in very small
amounts (40 mg/day) and only around the eyes (Ref. 12). Because dermal absorption of lead is
so small, we estimated that exposure to 10 ppm lead from an eye shadow is only 1.64 × 10[-3]
μg/day for adults and adolescents age 13 years or older and 1.64 × 10[-4] μg/day for children age
12 years or younger (assuming that children age 12 years or younger use 10% as much eye
shadow as adults). This means that exposure to lead from an eye shadow is approximately 150
times lower than exposure to lead from a cosmetic lip product.

The amount of exposure to lead as an impurity in a product such as body lotion is higher because
average applications are higher (8.7 g/day) (Ref. 9). Based on body surface area calculations
from reported height and weight data, we estimated that children age 6-18 use 65% as much
body lotion as adults age ≥19 and children age 1-5 use 34% as much body lotion as adults age
≥19 (Refs. 10, 13). We then estimated that exposure to 10 ppm lead from a body lotion is 0.36
µg/day for adults age ≥19, 0.23 µg/day for children age 6-18, and 0.12 µg/day for children age 15. In addition, our surveys found that body lotions actually contain very little lead (0.04 to 0.10
µg/g) (Refs. 6, 7). Therefore, we estimated that exposure to lead from a body lotion containing
0.10 µg/g (0.10 ppm) lead is 0.0036 µg/day for adults age ≥19, 0.0023 µg/day for children age 618, and 0.0012 µg/day for children age 1-5, or 67 times lower for adults and up to 20 times lower
for children than exposure to lead from a cosmetic lip product.

Exposure to lead from externally applied cosmetics is up to 150 times lower than exposure to
lead from cosmetic lip products. Therefore, the potential elevation of blood lead levels from 10
ppm lead in these products is too small to be measured in routine blood analysis and requires
state of the art analytical technology (Ref. 10).

**3. Public Health Impact of Recommended Maximum Lead Level in Cosmetic Lip Products**
**and Externally Applied Cosmetics**


-----

## Page 83

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

Based on our exposure assessment, we have concluded that a recommended maximum level of
10 ppm for lead as an impurity in cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics would
not pose a health risk. The issuance of this guidance supports our effort to limit human exposure
to lead in finished FDA-regulated cosmetic products by educating new manufacturers who wish
to enter the market and encouraging current manufacturers to continue to follow or improve on
voluntary good manufacturing practices that limit trace amounts of lead as an impurity. We
consider the recommended maximum lead level to be achievable with the use of good
manufacturing practices and to be consistent with the 10 ppm maximum lead level for similar
products recommended by other countries.

Lead is a chemical element for which toxicity in humans has been well documented (Ref. 14). It
may occur as an impurity in any of the ingredients used in cosmetic lip products and externally
applied cosmetics due to its background presence in the environment. Cosmetics manufacturers
are responsible for avoiding potentially harmful levels of lead in their finished products. Our
data show that over 99% of the cosmetic lip products and externally applied cosmetics on the
U.S. market contain lead at levels below our recommended maximum level. Therefore, we
encourage firms to continue the manufacturing practices that achieve these lower levels of lead
in their finished products.

**C. Enforcement Policy for Lead in Cosmetic Lip Products and Externally Applied**
**Cosmetics**

FDA is prepared to take enforcement action against any cosmetic lip product or externally
applied cosmetic containing lead at levels that may harm consumers. FDA intends to consider
several factors in bringing enforcement actions regarding lead in cosmetic lip products and
externally applied cosmetics, including the level of lead present, the particular product, and the
conditions of use for the product.

16 **I.** **INTRODUCTION**
17
18 This guidance is intended to describe the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA’s) current
19 thinking regarding the scope and application of part 11 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal
20 Regulations; Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures (21 CFR Part 11).[2]
21
22 This document provides guidance to persons who, in fulfillment of a requirement in a statute or
23 another part of FDA's regulations to maintain records or submit information to FDA, [3] have
24 chosen to maintain the records or submit designated information electronically and, as a result,
25 have become subject to part 11. Part 11 applies to records in electronic form that are created,
26 modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, or transmitted under any records requirements set
27 forth in Agency regulations. Part 11 also applies to electronic records submitted to the Agency
28 under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and the Public Health Service Act (the
29 PHS Act), even if such records are not specifically identified in Agency regulations (§ 11.1).
30 The underlying requirements set forth in the Act, PHS Act, and FDA regulations (other than part
31 11) are referred to in this guidance document as predicate rules.
32

1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Compliance in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
(CDER) in consultation with the other Agency centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the Food and Drug
Administration.

2 62 FR 13430

3 These requirements include, for example, certain provisions of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice
regulations (21 CFR Part 211), the Quality System regulation (21 CFR Part 820), and the Good Laboratory Practice
for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies regulations (21 CFR Part 58).


-----

## Page 89

33 As an outgrowth of its current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) initiative for human and
34 animal drugs and biologics,[4] FDA is re-examining part 11 as it applies to all FDA regulated
35 products. We anticipate initiating rulemaking to change part 11 as a result of that re36 examination. This guidance explains that we will narrowly interpret the scope of part 11. While
37 the re-examination of part 11 is under way, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with
38 respect to certain part 11 requirements. That is, we do not intend to take enforcement action to
39 enforce compliance with the validation, audit trail, record retention, and record copying
40 requirements of part 11 as explained in this guidance. However, records must still be maintained
41 or submitted in accordance with the underlying predicate rules, and the Agency can take
42 regulatory action for noncompliance with such predicate rules.
43
44 In addition, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion and do not intend to take (or
45 recommend) action to enforce any part 11 requirements with regard to systems that were
46 operational before August 20, 1997, the effective date of part 11 (commonly known as legacy
47 systems) under the circumstances described in section III.C.3 of this guidance.
48
49 **_Note that part 11 remains in effect and that this exercise of enforcement discretion applies only_**
50 as identified in this guidance.
51
52 FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
53 responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
54 be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
55 cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
56 recommended, but not required.

59 **II.** **BACKGROUND**
60
61 In March of 1997, FDA issued final part 11 regulations that provide criteria for acceptance by
62 FDA, under certain circumstances, of electronic records, electronic signatures, and handwritten
63 signatures executed to electronic records as equivalent to paper records and handwritten
64 signatures executed on paper. These regulations, which apply to all FDA program areas, were
65 intended to permit the widest possible use of electronic technology, compatible with FDA's
66 responsibility to protect the public health.
67
68 After part 11 became effective in August 1997, significant discussions ensued among industry,
69 contractors, and the Agency concerning the interpretation and implementation of the regulations.
70 FDA has (1) spoken about part 11 at many conferences and met numerous times with an industry
71 coalition and other interested parties in an effort to hear more about potential part 11 issues; (2)
72 published a compliance policy guide, CPG 7153.17: Enforcement Policy: 21 CFR Part 11;
73 Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures; and (3) published numerous draft guidance
74 documents including the following:

84 Throughout all of these communications, concerns have been raised that some interpretations of
85 the part 11 requirements would (1) unnecessarily restrict the use of electronic technology in a
86 manner that is inconsistent with FDA's stated intent in issuing the rule, (2) significantly increase
87 the costs of compliance to an extent that was not contemplated at the time the rule was drafted,
88 and (3) discourage innovation and technological advances without providing a significant public
89 health benefit. These concerns have been raised particularly in the areas of part 11 requirements
90 for validation, audit trails, record retention, record copying, and legacy systems.
91
92 As a result of these concerns, we decided to review the part 11 documents and related issues,
93 particularly in light of the Agency's CGMP initiative. In the Federal Register of February 4,
94 2003 (68 FR 5645), we announced the withdrawal of the draft guidance for industry, 21 CFR
95 _Part 11; Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures, Electronic Copies of Electronic Records._
96 We had decided we wanted to minimize industry time spent reviewing and commenting on the
97 draft guidance when that draft guidance may no longer represent our approach under the CGMP
98 initiative. Then, in the Federal Register of February 25, 2003 (68 FR 8775), we announced the
99 withdrawal of the part 11 draft guidance documents on validation, glossary of terms, time
100 stamps,[5] maintenance of electronic records, and CPG 7153.17. We received valuable public
101 comments on these draft guidances, and we plan to use that information to help with future
102 decision-making with respect to part 11. We do not intend to re-issue these draft guidance
103 documents or the CPG.
104
105 We are now re-examining part 11, and we anticipate initiating rulemaking to revise provisions of
106 that regulation. To avoid unnecessary resource expenditures to comply with part 11
107 requirements, we are issuing this guidance to describe how we intend to exercise enforcement
108 discretion with regard to certain part 11 requirements during the re-examination of part 11. As
109 mentioned previously, part 11 remains in effect during this re-examination period.
110
111
112 **III.** **DISCUSSION**
113
114 **A.** **Overall Approach to Part 11 Requirements**
115

5 Although we withdrew the draft guidance on time stamps, our current thinking has not changed in that when using
time stamps for systems that span different time zones, we do not expect you to record the signer’s local time. When
using time stamps, they should be implemented with a clear understanding of the time zone reference used. In such
instances, system documentation should explain time zone references as well as zone acronyms or other naming
conventions.


-----

## Page 91

116 As described in more detail below, the approach outlined in this guidance is based on three main
117 elements:
118
119 - Part 11 will be interpreted narrowly; we are now clarifying that fewer records will be
120 considered subject to part 11.

121 - For those records that remain subject to part 11, we intend to exercise enforcement
122 discretion with regard to part 11 requirements for validation, audit trails, record retention,
123 and record copying in the manner described in this guidance and with regard to all part 11
124 requirements for systems that were operational before the effective date of part 11 (also
125 known as legacy systems).

126 - We will enforce all predicate rule requirements, including predicate rule record and
127 recordkeeping requirements.

128 It is important to note that FDA's exercise of enforcement discretion as described in this
129 guidance is limited to specified part 11 requirements (setting aside legacy systems, as to which
130 the extent of enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, will be more broad). We
131 intend to enforce all other provisions of part 11 including, but not limited to, certain controls for
132 closed systems in § 11.10. For example, we intend to enforce provisions related to the following
133 controls and requirements:
134
135 - limiting system access to authorized individuals
136 - use of operational system checks
137 - use of authority checks
138 - use of device checks
139 - determination that persons who develop, maintain, or use electronic systems have the
140 education, training, and experience to perform their assigned tasks
141 - establishment of and adherence to written policies that hold individuals accountable for
142 actions initiated under their electronic signatures
143 - appropriate controls over systems documentation
144 - controls for open systems corresponding to controls for closed systems bulleted above (§
145 11.30)
146 - requirements related to electronic signatures (e.g., §§ 11.50, 11.70, 11.100, 11.200, and
147 11.300)
148
149 We expect continued compliance with these provisions, and we will continue to enforce them.
150 Furthermore, persons must comply with applicable predicate rules, and records that are required
151 to be maintained or submitted must remain secure and reliable in accordance with the predicate
152 rules.
153
154 **B.** **Details of Approach – Scope of Part 11**
155
156 _1.  Narrow Interpretation of Scope_
157
158 We understand that there is some confusion about the scope of part 11. Some have understood
159 the scope of part 11 to be very broad. We believe that some of those broad interpretations could


-----

## Page 92

160 lead to unnecessary controls and costs and could discourage innovation and technological
161 advances without providing added benefit to the public health. As a result, we want to clarify
162 that the Agency intends to interpret the scope of part 11 narrowly.
163
164 Under the narrow interpretation of the scope of part 11, with respect to records required to be
165 maintained under predicate rules or submitted to FDA, when persons choose to use records in
166 electronic format in place of paper format, part 11 would apply. On the other hand, when
167 persons use computers to generate paper printouts of electronic records, and those paper records
168 meet all the requirements of the applicable predicate rules and persons rely on the paper records
169 to perform their regulated activities, FDA would generally not consider persons to be "using
170 electronic records in lieu of paper records" under §§ 11.2(a) and 11.2(b). In these instances, the
171 use of computer systems in the generation of paper records would not trigger part 11.
172
173 _2.  Definition of Part 11 Records_
174
175 Under this narrow interpretation, FDA considers part 11 to be applicable to the following records
176 or signatures in electronic format (part 11 records or signatures):
177
178 - Records that are required to be maintained under predicate rule requirements and that are
179 maintained in electronic format in place of paper format. On the other hand, records (and
180 any associated signatures) that are not required to be retained under predicate rules, but
181 that are nonetheless maintained in electronic format, are not part 11 records.

182 We recommend that you determine, based on the predicate rules, whether specific records
183 are part 11 records. We recommend that you document such decisions.
184

185 - Records that are required to be maintained under predicate rules, that are maintained in
186 electronic format in addition to paper format, and that are relied on to perform regulated
187 _activities._

188 In some cases, actual business practices may dictate whether you are using electronic
189 records instead of paper records under § 11.2(a). For example, if a record is required to
190 be maintained under a predicate rule and you use a computer to generate a paper printout
191 of the electronic records, but you nonetheless rely on the electronic record to perform
192 regulated activities, the Agency may consider you to be using the electronic record
193 instead of the paper record. That is, the Agency may take your business practices into
194 account in determining whether part 11 applies.

195 Accordingly, we recommend that, for each record required to be maintained under
196 predicate rules, you determine in advance whether you plan to rely on the electronic
197 record or paper record to perform regulated activities. We recommend that you
198 document this decision (e.g., in a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), or specification
199 document).

200 - Records submitted to FDA, under predicate rules (even if such records are not
201 specifically identified in Agency regulations) in electronic format (assuming the records
202 have been identified in docket number 92S-0251 as the types of submissions the Agency
203 accepts in electronic format). However, a record that is not itself submitted, but is used


-----

## Page 93

204 in generating a submission, is not a part 11 record unless it is otherwise required to be
205 maintained under a predicate rule and it is maintained in electronic format.

206 - Electronic signatures that are intended to be the equivalent of handwritten signatures,
207 initials, and other general signings required by predicate rules. Part 11 signatures include
208 electronic signatures that are used, for example, to document the fact that certain events
209 or actions occurred in accordance with the predicate rule (e.g. approved, reviewed, and
210 _verified)._
211
212 **C.** **Approach to Specific Part 11 Requirements**
213
214 _1._ _Validation_
215
216 The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding specific part 11 requirements
217 for validation of computerized systems (§ 11.10(a) and corresponding requirements in § 11.30).
218 Although persons must still comply with all applicable predicate rule requirements for validation
219 (e.g., 21 CFR 820.70(i)), this guidance should not be read to impose any additional requirements
220 for validation.
221
222 We suggest that your decision to validate computerized systems, and the extent of the validation,
223 take into account the impact the systems have on your ability to meet predicate rule
224 requirements. You should also consider the impact those systems might have on the accuracy,
225 reliability, integrity, availability, and authenticity of required records and signatures. Even if
226 there is no predicate rule requirement to validate a system, in some instances it may still be
227 important to validate the system.
228
229 We recommend that you base your approach on a justified and documented risk assessment and
230 a determination of the potential of the system to affect product quality and safety, and record
231 integrity. For instance, validation would not be important for a word processor used only to
232 generate SOPs.
233
234 For further guidance on validation of computerized systems, see FDA’s guidance for industry
235 and FDA staff General Principles of Software Validation and also industry guidance such as the
236 _GAMP 4 Guide (See References)._
237
238 _2._ _Audit Trail_
239
240 The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding specific part 11 requirements
241 related to computer-generated, time-stamped audit trails (§ 11.10 (e), (k)(2) and any
242 corresponding requirement in §11.30). Persons must still comply with all applicable predicate
243 rule requirements related to documentation of, for example, date (e.g., § 58.130(e)), time, or
244 sequencing of events, as well as any requirements for ensuring that changes to records do not
245 obscure previous entries.
246
247 Even if there are no predicate rule requirements to document, for example, date, time, or
248 sequence of events in a particular instance, it may nonetheless be important to have audit trails or
249 other physical, logical, or procedural security measures in place to ensure the trustworthiness and


-----

## Page 94

250 reliability of the records.[6] We recommend that you base your decision on whether to apply audit
251 trails, or other appropriate measures, on the need to comply with predicate rule requirements, a
252 justified and documented risk assessment, and a determination of the potential effect on product
253 quality and safety and record integrity. We suggest that you apply appropriate controls based on
254 such an assessment. Audit trails can be particularly appropriate when users are expected to
255 create, modify, or delete regulated records during normal operation.
256
257 _3._ _Legacy Systems[7]_
258
259 The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to all part 11 requirements
260 for systems that otherwise were operational prior to August 20, 1997, the effective date of part
261 11, under the circumstances specified below.
262
263 This means that the Agency does not intend to take enforcement action to enforce compliance
264 with any part 11 requirements if all the following criteria are met for a specific system:
265
266 - The system was operational before the effective date.
267 - The system met all applicable predicate rule requirements before the effective date.
268 - The system currently meets all applicable predicate rule requirements.
269 - You have documented evidence and justification that the system is fit for its intended use
270 (including having an acceptable level of record security and integrity, if applicable).
271
272 If a system has been changed since August 20, 1997, and if the changes would prevent the
273 system from meeting predicate rule requirements, Part 11 controls should be applied to Part 11
274 records and signatures pursuant to the enforcement policy expressed in this guidance.
275
276 _4._ _Copies of Records_
277
278 The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion with regard to specific part 11
279 requirements for generating copies of records (§ 11.10 (b) and any corresponding requirement in
280 §11.30). You should provide an investigator with reasonable and useful access to records during
281 an inspection. All records held by you are subject to inspection in accordance with predicate
282 rules (e.g., §§ 211.180(c), (d), and 108.35(c)(3)(ii)).
283
284 We recommend that you supply copies of electronic records by:
285
286 - Producing copies of records held in common portable formats when records are
287 maintained in these formats

288 - Using established automated conversion or export methods, where available, to make
289 copies in a more common format (examples of such formats include, but are not limited
290 to, PDF, XML, or SGML)

6 Various guidance documents on information security are available (see References).

7 In this guidance document, we use the term legacy system to describe systems already in operation before the
effective date of part 11.


-----

## Page 95

291 In each case, we recommend that the copying process used produces copies that preserve the
292 content and meaning of the record. If you have the ability to search, sort, or trend part 11
293 records, copies given to the Agency should provide the same capability if it is reasonable and
294 technically feasible. You should allow inspection, review, and copying of records in a human
295 readable form at your site using your hardware and following your established procedures and
296 techniques for accessing records.
297
298 _5._ _Record Retention_
299
300 The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion with regard to the part 11 requirements
301 for the protection of records to enable their accurate and ready retrieval throughout the records
302 retention period (§ 11.10 (c) and any corresponding requirement in §11.30). Persons must still
303 comply with all applicable predicate rule requirements for record retention and availability (e.g.,
304 §§ 211.180(c),(d), 108.25(g), and 108.35(h)).
305
306 We suggest that your decision on how to maintain records be based on predicate rule
307 requirements and that you base your decision on a justified and documented risk assessment and
308 a determination of the value of the records over time.
309
310 FDA does not intend to object if you decide to archive required records in electronic format to
311 nonelectronic media such as microfilm, microfiche, and paper, or to a standard electronic file
312 format (examples of such formats include, but are not limited to, PDF, XML, or SGML).
313 Persons must still comply with all predicate rule requirements, and the records themselves and
314 any copies of the required records should preserve their content and meaning. As long as
315 predicate rule requirements are fully satisfied and the content and meaning of the records are
316 preserved and archived, you can delete the electronic version of the records. In addition, paper
317 and electronic record and signature components can co-exist (i.e., a hybrid[8] situation) as long as
318 predicate rule requirements are met and the content and meaning of those records are preserved.
319

8 Examples of hybrid situations include combinations of paper records (or other nonelectronic media) and electronic
records, paper records and electronic signatures, or handwritten signatures executed to electronic records.

###### Guidance for Industry[1]
 Safety of Nanomaterials in Cosmetic Products

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA’s) current thinking on this
topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the telephone number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

###### I. Introduction

This document provides guidance to industry and other stakeholders (e.g., academia, other
regulatory groups) on FDA’s current thinking on the safety assessment of nanomaterials in
cosmetic products. The guidance document is intended to assist industry and other
stakeholders in identifying the potential safety issues of nanomaterials in cosmetic products
and developing a framework for evaluating them. This guidance also provides contact
information for manufacturers and sponsors who wish to discuss safety considerations
regarding the use of specific nanomaterials in cosmetic products with FDA. This guidance is
not applicable to other products regulated by FDA, including over-the-counter and
prescription drugs and medical devices.

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word “should” in our guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

###### II. Background

Nanomaterials are used in a variety of FDA-regulated products because of their unique
properties, imparting potential advantages to products considered for development. Such
materials, due to their nanoscale size, can have chemical, physical, and biological properties
that differ from those of their larger counterparts. Such differences may include altered
magnetic properties, altered electrical or optical activity, increased structural integrity, or
altered chemical or biological activity (Ref. 1). These new or altered properties may affect
the performance, quality, safety, and/or effectiveness, if applicable, of a product that
incorporates that nanomaterial.

Applied Nutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

In July of 2007, FDA issued a report prepared by its Nanotechnology Task Force (“Task
Force”). The Task Force report presented an assessment of scientific and regulatory
considerations relating to the safety and effectiveness of FDA-regulated products containing
nanomaterials and made recommendations in light of these considerations (Ref. 2).
Specifically, with respect to cosmetic products, the Task Force recommended that we issue
guidance describing safety issues that manufacturers should consider to ensure that
cosmetic products made with nanomaterials are safe and not adulterated. We are issuing
this guidance as part of our ongoing efforts to implement the Task Force recommendations
(Ref. 2).

The Task Force also recommended that FDA request submission of data and other
information addressing the effects of nanomaterials in those products that are not subject to
premarket authorization, such as cosmetic products. On September 8, 2008, FDA held a
public meeting to discuss such data and information, along with related scientific and
regulatory issues concerning nanotechnology. FDA considered the information obtained at,
and subsequent to, the public meeting in developing this guidance. We also considered
information provided by the cosmetic industry to the International Cooperation on
Cosmetics Regulations (ICCR), publications and information regarding recent advances in
nanotechnology, and other authoritative guidance/ reports regarding the safety of
nanomaterials (Refs. 3, 4, 5, 6). This guidance also refers to other relevant reports, such as
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Working Party on
Manufactured Nanomaterials “Preliminary Review of OECD Test Guidelines for their
Applicability to Manufactured Nanomaterials” (Ref. 7), the Scientific Committee on
Consumer Safety (SCCS) “Guidance on the Safety Assessment of Nanomaterials in
Cosmetics” (Ref. 8), and relevant ICCR reports, such as on the “Currently Available
Methods for Characterization of Nanomaterials,” and “Principles of Cosmetic Product
Safety Assessment.” (Refs. 9, 10).

FDA has not established regulatory definitions of “nanotechnology,” “nanomaterial,”
“nanoscale,” or other related terms. In June 2014, FDA issued a guidance for industry titled
“Considering Whether an FDA-Regulated Product Involves the Application of
Nanotechnology” (Ref. 1). As described in that guidance, at this time, when considering
whether an FDA-regulated product involves the application of nanotechnology, FDA will
ask: (1) whether a material or end product is engineered to have at least one external
dimension, or an internal or surface structure, in the nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to
100 nm); and (2) whether a material or end product is engineered to exhibit properties or
phenomena, including physical or chemical properties or biological effects, that are
attributable to its dimension(s), even if these dimensions fall outside the nanoscale range, up
to one micrometer (1,000 nm). We will apply these considerations broadly to all FDAregulated products, including cosmetic products.

The application of nanotechnology may result in product attributes that differ from those of
conventionally-manufactured products, and thus may merit particular examination.
However, we do not categorically judge all products containing nanomaterials or otherwise
involving application of nanotechnology as intrinsically benign or harmful. Rather, for


-----

nanotechnology-derived and conventionally-manufactured cosmetic products alike, we
consider the characteristics of the finished product and the safety for its intended use. Our
consideration of nanotechnology applications in cosmetic products in this document is
consistent with the agency guidance (Ref. 1) and with the broader federal guidance on
regulatory oversight of emerging technologies (Ref. 11) and nanotechnology (Ref. 12).

###### III. Discussion

 A.  General Framework for Assessing the Safety of Nanomaterials in Cosmetic Products

Section 301(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C.
331(a)) prohibits the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics [2 ] in interstate
commerce. The FD&C Act does not subject cosmetics or cosmetic ingredients (with the
exception of color additives) to FDA premarket approval in order to be marketed legally in
the United States. Except for color additives and those ingredients that are prohibited or
restricted from use in cosmetics by regulation, a manufacturer may use any ingredient in the
formulation of a cosmetic provided that the use of the ingredient does not otherwise cause
the cosmetic to be adulterated (section 601 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 361)) or
misbranded (section 602 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 362)). [3]

Cosmetic product manufacturers must ensure that the product is not misbranded or
adulterated. The FD&C Act does not give us the authority to require that safety data be
submitted to us or to approve a cosmetic product before it is marketed. Nevertheless,
manufacturers or distributors are responsible for obtaining all data and information needed
to substantiate the safety of their products before introducing them into the marketplace.

In the Federal Register of March 3, 1975 (40 FR 8912 at 8916), we advised that “the safety
of a product can be adequately substantiated through (a) reliance on already available
toxicological test data on individual ingredients and on product formulations that are similar
in composition to the particular cosmetic, and (b) performance of any additional
toxicological and other tests that are appropriate in light of such existing data and
information. Although satisfactory toxicological data may exist for each ingredient of a
cosmetic product, it will still be necessary to conduct some toxicological testing with the
complete formulation to assure adequately the safety of the finished cosmetic.”

We believe that these general principles are applicable to the safety substantiation of
cosmetic products whether they contain nanomaterials or conventionally manufactured

2 The FD&C Act defines cosmetics by their intended use as “articles intended to be rubbed, poured,
sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying,
promoting attractiveness or altering the appearance, and articles intended for use as a component of any such
articles; except that such term shall not include soap” (section 201(i) of the FD&C Act).
3 The name of each ingredient must be declared on the label of the cosmetic product, as required by 21 CFR
701.3.

ingredients. In applying these principles, however, it may be important to give particular
consideration to the fact that a material at nanoscale may show changes in, or have novel,
physicochemical properties, behaviors, and/or effects that could be different from a larger
scale material with the same chemical composition (Refs. 2, 8).

For example, the small particle size of a nanomaterial has the potential to alter the
distribution and bioavailability of that material compared to a larger scale material with the
same chemical composition. The small size leads to increased surface area relative to the
mass of the particle, which could result in increased biological interactions. In addition,
the uptake, absorption, and biodistribution of the material may be altered, leading to
potential systemic exposure (Refs. 5, 8).

In some cases, the traditional testing methods that have been used to determine the safety
of cosmetic ingredients and finished products may not be fully applicable due to a
nanomaterial’s distinctive properties and behavior. Such distinctive physicochemical
characteristics or biological interactions may affect the results or interpretation of results
obtained from traditional toxicology testing, which form an integral part of safety
substantiation. In Section III.B of this document, we highlight key scientific
considerations relevant to the assessment of the safety of nanomaterials used in cosmetic
products.

If you wish to use a nanomaterial in a cosmetic product, either a new material or an
altered version of an already marketed ingredient, we encourage you to meet with us to
discuss the test methods and data that might help substantiate the product’s safety,
including short-term toxicity and long-term toxicity data, as appropriate. We encourage
you to contact us to discuss any aspect of the safety assessment of cosmetic ingredients or
finished products.

###### B. Points to Consider in Assessing the Safety of Nanomaterials in Cosmetic Products

We consider the current framework for safety assessment sufficiently robust and flexible to
be appropriate for a variety of materials, including products containing nanomaterials. Just
as the traditional safety assessment includes material characterization and toxicology
considerations, safety evaluations of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials should also
take these considerations into account. As noted in section III.A, nanomaterials may exhibit
new or altered physicochemical properties that may affect biological interactions, which
may raise questions about the safety of the product containing nanomaterials. Any such
unique properties or biological effects of nanomaterials should be identified and
appropriately addressed during safety evaluations.

With respect to nanomaterial characterization, safety should be assessed through fully
describing the nanomaterial and evaluating a wide range of physical and chemical
properties, as well as through the assessment of impurities, if present. The toxicology and
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion considerations for nanomaterials in
cosmetic products can be informed by addressing the routes of exposure, the uptake and


-----

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

absorption, and toxicity testing. In addition, any distinctive properties and biological
behavior of nanomaterials should be considered in determining the suitability of traditional
testing methods for toxicity testing of cosmetic products containing nanomaterials. As
needed, traditional toxicity testing methods should be modified or new methods developed
to address: (1) the key chemical and physical properties that may affect the toxicity profile
of nanomaterials and (2) the effects of those properties on the function of the cosmetic
formulation. The toxicological testing should include consideration of toxicity of both the
ingredients and impurities; dosimetry for in vitro and in vivo toxicology studies, if needed;
clinical testing, if warranted; and toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. The overall package of
data and information should substantiate the safety of the product under the intended
conditions of use. These considerations are discussed in greater detail in sections III.B.1 and
III.B.2 below.

###### 1. Nanomaterial Characterization

Nanomaterials vary widely in composition, morphology, and other characteristics and
cannot be considered a uniform group of substances. These substances may have physical,
chemical, or biological properties that are different from those of larger scale material with
the same chemical composition. As stated earlier, such differences may include altered
magnetic properties, altered electrical or optical activity, increased structural integrity, or
altered chemical or biological activity (Ref. 6).

As discussed in the FDA Task Force report, studies indicate that various attributes of a
particular nanoscale material, including increased surface-area-to-volume ratio,
morphology, surface features, and charge, can affect the distribution of that material in the
body and that material’s interaction with biological systems (Ref. 2, 8). Therefore,
thorough characterization of nanomaterials can form an integral part of the safety
assessment. This would include proper identification of the chemical composition as well
as impurities, structure, and configuration of the nanomaterial(s) used in the cosmetic
product. In addition, characterization of the nanomaterial(s) as present in the raw
material, formulation, test media, and in the relevant biological environment for
toxicological testing should be considered to help determine potential biological
interactions and effects (Ref. 8). In addition, stability of the nanomaterial under testing
conditions and in a formulation under intended conditions of use should be determined.

**a.** **Physicochemical Properties**

As with any cosmetic ingredient, the nanomaterial should be fully described, including:

    - the nanomaterial name,

    - the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number,

    - the structural formula,

    - the elemental and molecular composition including:


-----

## Page 104

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

`o` the degree of purity, and

`o` any known impurities or additives.

A thorough understanding of the details of the manufacturing process will help identify
residual additives and impurities, as well as certain other physical and chemical properties.
A wide range of physical and chemical properties should be evaluated to help determine if a
substance produced with nanotechnology is safe for the proposed use (Refs. 7, 13, 14, 15).
Proper characterization should include, as appropriate:

    - measurement of particle size and distribution,

    - aggregation and agglomeration characteristics,

    - surface chemistry, including:
`o` zeta potential/surface charge,
`o` surface coating,
`o` functionalization, and
`o` catalytic activity

    - morphology including:
`o` shape,
`o` surface area,
`o` surface topology, and
`o` crystallinity

    - solubility,

    - density,

    - stability, and

    - porosity.

Although a wide range of analytical techniques are available for measurement of
physicochemical properties of materials (Refs. 8, 9, 16), many of these methods have not
been validated for the evaluation of nanomaterials in cosmetic products. Therefore,
appropriate analytical methods suitable for the specific nanomaterial and the cosmetic
product formulation should be chosen, and results obtained from such tests appropriately
interpreted and reported for adequate characterization of the material.

**b.** **Impurities**

As with any cosmetic ingredient, a change in the starting material used to prepare a
formulation will likely result in altered composition of the final product, which may result in
different impurities. Variables such as altered purity or changes in the starting material
should be considered. A manufacturer should assess the identity and quantity of impurities
and how they may affect the overall safety of the end product.

It is also important to understand how the nanomaterial is manufactured. Nanoscale
impurities may arise from the manufacturing process. Changes in the manufacturing


-----

## Page 105

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

process, including use of different solvents, time/temperature conditions and changes to the
starting chemicals (e.g., alternative starting materials, different purity levels or different
concentrations of the chemicals used in the process) may change the types and/or quantities
of impurities in the final product. Additional agents, such as dispersing agents and surface
modifiers, are often used in the manufacture of nanomaterials. These additional agents and
impurities should be considered in the safety substantiation for nanomaterials in cosmetic
products.

###### 2. Toxicology Considerations

The appropriateness of toxicological testing depends on the intended use, exposure levels,
and degree of concern for potential toxicity of an ingredient or formulation. In determining
what toxicological testing may be appropriate, manufacturers should consider each
ingredient’s chemical structure and composition, and physicochemical properties,
purity/impurities, agglomeration and size distribution, stability, conditions of exposure,
uptake and absorption, bioavailability, toxicity, and any other qualities that may affect the
safety of the product for its intended use.  Manufacturers should address both short-term
and long-term toxicity of nanomaterials (Ref. 8), and consider the need to evaluate the
possibility of ingredient-ingredient interactions or ingredient-packaging interactions.

Where traditional toxicity test methods are used, manufacturers should consider the
applicability of the test methods and, as needed, modify them with respect to such factors as
appropriate solvents and dosing formulations, solubility, agglomeration and aggregation of
particles, and stability conditions associated with the cosmetic product containing
nanomaterials (Refs. 2, 17, 18). For example, whether a nanomaterial is soluble, insoluble,
or partially-soluble may affect the suitability of a traditional toxicity test method. Some
traditional in vivo test methods may be suitable for only soluble nanomaterials (Ref. 17).
Some traditional in vitro and in vivo test methods may need to be adjusted for testing
insoluble or partially-soluble nanomaterials (Refs. 7, 18). These considerations are
important because nanoparticles tend to stick to each other to form larger
agglomerates/aggregates that may be insoluble. Therefore, in a dosing or test medium,
nanomaterials may be present as a nano-dispersion rather than in solution (Refs. 7, 18).
Agglomeration and aggregation of particles is another factor that may affect the suitability
of traditional toxicity testing methods, and manufacturers should ensure that testing
appropriately reflects the range of free particles and any aggregates or aggolomerates found
in the cosmetic product formulation. Toxicological testing may need to be conducted
separately on the free nanoparticles and the agglomerated/aggregated nanoparticles because
they will likely have different chemical and biological properties. Due to their high surface
energy, nanomaterials may also interact with the testing medium or bind to different
substances, including proteins, in the test medium, resulting in an altered biological activity
(Refs. 8, 19, 20, 21). Thus, manufacturers should consider and make necessary adjustments
to traditional toxicity testing methods, taking into account the specific characteristics of the
nanomaterial as it is intended to be used in the cosmetic product. In instances where
traditional toxicity testing methods cannot be satisfactorily modified, FDA recommends
developing new methods to adequately assess the toxicity of the nanomaterial in the
cosmetic product and ensure the product is safe.


-----

## Page 106

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

It is also important to mention that the dose metrics currently used for toxicological testing
of conventionally manufactured chemicals (measured and expressed in mass, volume or
number of particles such as mg/kg, or mg/L) may not be appropriate for nanomaterials
because of their large surface area per particle mass or volume (Refs. 5, 8). In addition to
weight/volume metrics, evaluations of the safety of nanomaterials should also consider
alternative metrics, such as weight/volume concentration, particle number concentration and
surface area, until suitable parameters for dose metrics become available.

**a.** **Routes of Exposure**

The safety of an ingredient is based in part on the potential for exposure and the relevant
routes of exposure that are determined by its intended use and its application. Although
most cosmetic products are applied directly to the skin, some products may be applied by
spray presenting the possibility of inhalation exposure. Additionally, some cosmetic
products are applied in an area where there is the possibility of oral exposure. Additionally,
systemic absorption can result from dermal, inhalation, ocular and oral exposures (Refs. 22,
23). Therefore, for nanomaterials, the dose to the primary exposure organs as well as the
dose to any secondary target organs should be considered in developing or modifying
toxicological testing methods and for evaluating the test data (Ref. 5).

**b.** **Uptake and Absorption**

As stated above, some nanomaterials have unique physicochemical properties that may alter
the potential toxicity of a compound (e.g. reduction in particle size could increase the ability
for the compound to be absorbed). Therefore, the safety assessment should address whether
there will be an increase in uptake, absorption, transport into cells, and transport across
barriers (e.g. blood-brain barrier) or altered bioavailability or biological half-life. For
example, there may be an increase in the dose delivered to sensitive tissues due to the
increased ability of the nanomaterial to pass through the blood-brain barrier (Ref. 24).

Nanomaterials used in cosmetic products can be divided into two groups: (1) soluble and/or
biodegradable nanoparticles, which disintegrate into their molecular components (e.g. some
liposomes and nanoemulsions) upon application to skin and thus may not raise safety
questions, and (2) insoluble, sufficiently stable and/or biopersistent nanoparticles (e.g.
titanium dioxide (TiO2), fullerenes, and quantum dots). Some insoluble, partially-soluble or
sufficiently stable nanomaterials, particularly those in the lower nanoscale range and with
certain surface characteristics, may be able to cross biological membrane barriers (Ref. 25)
and may have harmful effects due to the potential interaction with organs and cellular
compartments. Thus, when there is evidence of systemic exposure to nanomaterials,
manufacturers should consider including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
(ADME) parameters in safety assessments of the nanomaterial in the cosmetic product (Ref.
8).

For exposure via dermal absorption, studies should be conducted with both intact skin and
impaired skin (e.g. sunburned, atopic, eczematous, psoriatic, or systematically damaged skin)


-----

## Page 107

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

to address the possibility of an increased rate of penetration and ability of the ingredient to
become systemically absorbed. The passive transport of many nanomaterials may not occur
through intact skin, but there is an increased probability for entry of nanomaterials through
skin with an impaired barrier layer (Refs. 26, 27). A variety of techniques used to study and
quantify skin penetration of chemicals are discussed in the literature (Refs. 28, 29). We
recognize that there are limitations to using impaired skin models for conducting dermal
absorption studies as there is currently no standard or established method(s). We encourage
manufacturers to develop appropriate impaired skin models for dermal absorption studies.

The use of aerosolized cosmetic products can also result in exposure to nanomaterials via
the respiratory tract. The deposition of nanomaterials in the respiratory system depends
on their aerosol properties and interactions with respiratory epithelium. The soluble
nanoparticles may be dissolved, metabolized and transported to other organs and blood
whereas the insoluble nanoparticles may be either retained in the airways and result in
pulmonary effects or swallowed by coughing and cleared. As discussed earlier, the
physical characteristics, including surface properties of nanomaterials, are important
factors that warrant careful attention, particularly for inhaled nanoscale particles. Studies
have indicated that decreasing the size of particles and increasing the surface area can
result in potential adverse effects not only in the respiratory system, but also in the heart
and blood vessels, the central nervous system, and the immune system (Ref. 30).

Exposure via the oral route is generally limited to those products that are introduced into or
applied near the mouth (e.g., mouthwash, lipsticks). Limited evidence suggests that the
uptake of nanomaterials and systemic absorption depends on their size, surface charge, and
surface ligand modification (Ref. 30). Additional studies have indicated that nanomaterials
have limited uptake in the gastrointestinal tract, but the translocation to certain regions of
the intestinal barrier can be substantially increased (Refs. 31, 32).

Therefore, we recommend that the safety assessment process for nanomaterials include the
issues of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics with reference to different exposure routes.

**c.** **Toxicity Testing**

The initial step in the evaluation of the safety assessment of cosmetic products is to
conduct toxicity testing based on a toxicological profile of the ingredients and their routes
of exposure. There are several guidelines (Refs. 4, 33, 34) for conducting toxicity testing
(tiered testing strategy) of chemicals that can be used as a starting point in evaluating
toxicity of nanomaterial ingredients. Consistent with the guidelines issued by the
Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA) (Ref. 33) and the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (Ref. 3), we recommend, at a
minimum, testing for acute toxicity, skin irritation, ocular irritation, dermal photoirritation,
skin sensitization, mutagenicity/ genotoxicity, repeated dose (21-28 days) toxicity, and
subchronic (90 days) toxicity (Ref. 34). We also recommend phototoxicity testing (Ref.
35) for a cosmetic product that is intended to be used on sun-exposed skin. Results
obtained from this basic test battery may indicate a need for additional testing. Where
available, other relevant data, such as toxicological data on individual ingredients that are


-----

## Page 108

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

similar in composition to the nanomaterial or data on a larger scale material with the same
chemical composition as the nanomaterial, can also be considered.

As stated previously, in designing tests for use with nanomaterials in cosmetics products,
manufacturers should consider modifying traditional toxicity testing with respect to such
factors as appropriate solvents and dosing formulations, agglomeration of particles, purity
and stability conditions, and other variables. New methods may also need to be developed if
traditional tests cannot be modified satisfactorily. For example, the Ames test,
recommended as part of a battery of genotoxicity testing for conventional chemicals, may
not be suitable for insoluble or partially-soluble nanomaterials used in cosmetic products
because the bacterial cell wall may create a possible barrier for many nanomaterials (Ref.
36).

Toxicity testing in vivo has long been considered indispensable for obtaining information
on translocation, biodistribution, accumulation, and clearance (Ref. 37). As mentioned
earlier, while conducting in vivo toxicity testing for nanomaterials, careful attention should
be paid to the issue of dose metrics (mass, volume or number of particles). The
manufacturer should consider the surface area and number of particles, as well as mass
concentration in the study design of in vivo toxicity testing. For in vivo studies via the
dermal route of administration, the test substance should be applied directly to the skin,
and for the oral route of administration, the test substance should be given either by gavage
or in the diet. Agglomeration or aggregation characteristics of nanomaterials in the topical
vehicle, gavage or feed matrix are other important factors to assess prior to conducting
these studies for safety assessment. Additionally, the potential for nanomaterials to
penetrate through the skin or be absorbed through the gut and becoming available for
biodistribution, should be addressed while estimating the risks associated with the
exposure to nanomaterials.

There has been recent emphasis on the development of validated methods for in vitro
testing of cosmetic products by the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation
of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) and the European Center for the Validation of
Alternative Methods (ECVAM). The seventh amendment to Directive 2003/15/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council (Ref. 38) instituted a ban on animal testing of
cosmetic products in 2004 and a ban on certain animal tests with validated alternatives in
March 2009. We recommend validation of in vitro methods for safety testing of cosmetic
products and ingredients and optimizing these models for nanomaterials, with particular
attention being paid to the issues of cytotoxicity and precipitation of insoluble ingredients.
Nanomaterials can settle, diffuse, and aggregate differentially according to their size,
density, and surface chemistry (Ref. 39). Thus, the assessment of the agglomeration or
aggregation of nanomaterials in the media used in the in vitro system should be addressed.

Alternative testing methods currently under consideration that can be optimized for a
specific nanomaterial and might be useful to help determine ingredient safety include:

1. Reconstructed human skin such as Episkin[TM ]and Epiderm [TM ]for skin
irritation and corrosion testing;


-----

## Page 109

**_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_**

2. Phototoxicity testing via 3T3 NRPT (3T3 fibroblasts neutral red
uptake phototoxicity testing) applicable to ultra violet (UV) absorbing
substances;
3. Human/pig skin in a diffusion cell for dermal absorption;
4. Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability (BCOP) and the Isolated Chicken
Eye (ICE) for ocular irritation; and
5. Genotoxicity testing using a battery of recommended tests covering the
endpoints of gene mutation, and structural and numerical aberrations. While
conducting genotoxicty tests, the nanomaterial’s specific properties should
be taken into account to understand the mechanism of nanomaterials’
genotoxic effects (Ref. 36).

Finally, we note that in vivo studies may be more suitable for nanomaterials with limited
solubility properties (Ref. 8).

###### C. Summary of Recommendations

In summary, nanomaterials can have chemical, physical, and biological properties that differ
from those of larger scale particles with the same chemical composition, and the use of
nanomaterials in cosmetic products may raise questions about the safety of the product for
its intended use. As with any cosmetic product that has new or altered properties, data needs
and testing methods should be evaluated to address any unique properties and function of the
nanomaterials used in the cosmetic products as well as the questions that continue to remain
about the applicability of traditional safety testing methods to products that involve
nanotechnology. We recommend that the safety assessment for cosmetic products using
nanomaterials should address several important factors, including:

  - the physicochemical characteristics,

  - agglomeration and size distribution of nanomaterials under the conditions of
toxicity testing and as expected in the final product,

  - impurities,

  - potential routes of exposure to the nanomaterials,

  - potential for aggregation and agglomeration of nanoparticles in the final product,

  - dosimetry for in vitro and in vivo toxicology studies, and

  - _in vitro and in vivo toxicological data on nanomaterial ingredients and their_
impurities, dermal penetration, potential inhalation, irritation (skin and eye) and
sensitization studies, mutagenicity/genotoxicity studies.

We expect that the science surrounding nanomaterials will continue to evolve and be used
in the development of new testing methods.

The safety of a cosmetic product should be evaluated by analyzing the physicochemical
properties and the relevant toxicological endpoints of each ingredient in relation to the
expected exposure resulting from the intended use of the finished product. If you wish to
use a nanomaterial in a cosmetic product, either a new material or an altered version of an

already marketed ingredient, we encourage you to meet with us to discuss the test methods
and data needed to substantiate the product’s safety, including short-term toxicity and other
long-term toxicity data, as appropriate. We welcome your questions relating to the use of
nanomaterials in cosmetic products.

###### Complementary and Alternative Medicine Products and Their Regulation by the Food and Drug Administration[1]

This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the Food and Drug Administration's
(FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on
any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative
approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you
want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for
implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the
appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

###### I. Why Are We Issuing This Guidance?

The term “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM) encompasses a wide
array of health care practices, products, and therapies that are distinct from practices,
products, and therapies used in “conventional” or “allopathic” medicine. Some forms of
CAM, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, have been practiced
for centuries, whereas others, such as electrotherapy, are more recent in origin.

In the United States, the practice of CAM has risen dramatically in recent years.
In 1992, Congress established the Office of Unconventional Therapies, which later
became the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), to explore “unconventional medical
practices.” In 1998, OAM became the National Center for Complementary and
Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). NCCAM is a center within the National Institutes of
Health. The Institute of Medicine, in its book entitled, Complementary and Alternative
_Medicine in the United States, stated that more than one-third of American adults_
reported using some form of CAM and that visits to CAM providers each year exceed
those to primary care physicians.[2]

As the practice of CAM has increased in the United States, the Food and Drug
Administration (“FDA”, “we”) has seen increased confusion as to whether certain
products used in CAM (which, for convenience, we will refer to as “CAM products”) are
subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“the Act”) or
Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”). We have also seen an increase in the number of
CAM products imported into the United States. Therefore, we are providing guidance as

1  This guidance was prepared by the Office of Policy and Planning, Office of the Commissioner, Food and
Drug Administration, with assistance from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the Center
for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and the Center for
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.

to when a CAM product is subject to the Act or the PHS Act.[3] This guidance makes two
fundamental points:

! First, depending on the CAM therapy or practice, a product used in a
CAM therapy or practice may be subject to regulation as a biological
product, cosmetic, drug, device, or food (including food additives and
dietary supplements) under the Act or the PHS Act. For example, the PHS
Act defines “biological product,” and the Act defines (among other
things):

`o` Cosmetic;
`o` Device;
`o` Dietary supplement;
`o` Drug, as well as “new drug” and “new animal drug;”
`o` Food; and
`o` Food additive.
These statutory definitions cover some CAM products.
! Second, neither the Act nor the PHS Act exempts CAM products from
regulation. This means, for example, if a person decides to produce and
sell raw vegetable juice for use in juice therapy to promote optimal health,
that product is a food subject to the requirements for foods in the Act and
FDA regulations, including the hazard analysis and critical control point
(HACCP) system requirements for juices in 21 CFR part 120. If the juice
therapy is intended for use as part of a disease treatment regimen instead
of for the general wellness, the vegetable juice would also be subject to
regulation as a drug under the Act.
We explain these two points in greater detail later in this document.

###### II. What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)?

NCCAM defines CAM as “a group of diverse medical and health care systems,
practices, and products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional
medicine.”[4] It interprets “complementary” medicine as being used together with
conventional medicine, whereas “alternative” medicine is used in place of conventional
medicine.

NCCAM classifies CAM therapies into four categories or “domains.” These are:
! Biologically-based practices;
! Energy therapies;

3 When this guidance mentions a particular CAM therapy, practice, or product, it does so
in order to provide background information or to serve as an example or illustration; any
mention of a particular CAM therapy, practice, or product should not be construed as
expressing FDA’s support for or endorsement of that particular CAM therapy, practice,
or product or, unless specified otherwise, as an agency determination that a particular
product is safe and effective for its intended uses or is safe for use.

! Manipulative and body-based methods; and
! Mind-body medicine.
NCCAM once had a fifth domain, “Alternative medical systems,” but now considers
“alternative medical systems” (now known as “whole medical systems”) to be a separate
category rather than another domain because alternative medical systems use practices
from the four domains listed above. For purposes of this guidance, we adopt the same
domains and “whole medical systems” category that NCCAM uses.

###### A. What Are “Biologically Based Practices?”

According to NCCAM, the domain called “biologically based practices” includes,
but is not limited to, botanicals, animal-derived extracts, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids,
amino acids, proteins, prebiotics[5] and probiotics,[6] whole diets, and “functional foods”.[7]

Many biologically-based products within this domain are subject to statutory and
regulatory requirements under the Act or the PHS Act. The intended use of a product
plays a central role in how it is regulated. For example:

! Botanical products, depending on the circumstances, may be regulated as
drugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements, or foods.[8] All four types of

5  Prebiotics have been defined as nondigestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by
selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon (see
Gibson, G.R. and Roberfroid, M.B., “Dietary Modulation of the Human Colonic Microbiota: Introducing
the Concept of Prebiotics,” Journal of Nutrition, 125: 1401-1412 (1995)). Oligosaccharides are commonly
used as prebiotics.
6  “Probiotics” have been defined as live microbial food supplements which beneficially affect the host
animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance (see Fuller, R., “Probiotics in Man and Animals,”
Journal of Applied Bacteriology, 66: 365-378 (1989)) and as live microorganisms which, when consumed
in adequate amounts of food, confer a health benefit on the host (see Food and Agriculture Organization
and World Health Organization, “Health and Nutritional Properties of Probiotics in Food including Powder
Milk with Live Lactic Acid Bacteria” (1-4 October 2001)). For purposes of this document, we will
consider probiotics to refer to whole, live microorganisms that are ingested with the intention of providing
a health benefit (such as supporting digestion and nutrient adsorption in the intestine). Our Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition, simply refers to such bacteria as “live microorganisms.”
“Probiotics” are not defined as a regulatory product category under the Act or the PHS Act, and
products that may be considered to be “probiotics” may be foods or drugs under the Act, depending on the
intended use of the product.
7  See NCCAM, “BACKGROUNDER: Biologically Based Practices: An Overview” (October 2004), at
page 1 (available at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/biobasedprac.pdf) (accessed on November
22, 2005)). NCCAM interprets “functional foods” as “components of the usual diet that may have
biologically active components (e.g., polyphenols, phytoestrogens, fish oils, carotenoids) that may provide
health benefits beyond basic nutrition” (id. at page 3). However, “functional foods” are not defined as a
regulatory product category, and products that NCCAM would interpret to be “functional foods” would
either be foods or drugs to FDA, depending on the claims associated with the product.
8  Although dietary supplements are a type of food (see section 201(ff) of the Act (last sentence)), for ease
of reference, we will use the term “food” to refer to foods other than dietary supplements (e.g.,
conventional foods, food additives, or GRAS substances intended for use in food) throughout the
remainder of this guidance. We may discuss specific types of “foods,” such as “food additives,” separately

products are subject to the Act. For example, a botanical product intended
for use in treating a disease would generally be regulated as a drug; a
botanical product taken by mouth, labeled as a dietary supplement, and
intended for use to affect the structure or function of the body would
generally be regulated as a dietary supplement; a raw or dried botanical
intended for use as an ingredient to flavor food would generally be
regulated as a food or as a food additive, depending on whether the
botanical was generally recognized as safe for its intended use in food; and
a lotion containing botanical ingredients and intended for use in
moisturizing the skin would generally be regulated as a cosmetic.
! Probiotics may be regulated as dietary supplements, foods, or drugs under
the Act, depending on the product’s intended use. Other factors may also
affect the classification of the product, e.g., whether the product contains a
“dietary ingredient” as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C.
321(ff)(1)), whether it is represented as a conventional food or as a meal
replacement (see section 201(ff)(2)(B) of the Act), and, for probiotics used
as ingredients in a conventional food, whether the ingredient is generally
recognized as safe for its intended use (see section 201(s) of the Act (21
U.S.C. 321(s)).  In addition to any requirements that apply based on the
product’s classification under the Act, probiotics may also be subject to
the PHS Act’s provisions concerning the prevention of communicable
disease, due to potential disease-causing microorganisms that might be
contained in such products. Finally, if a probiotic is a drug under the Act,
it may be subject to regulation as a biological product under the PHS Act
as well.
! Products that NCCAM would consider to be “functional foods” may be
subject to FDA regulation as foods, dietary supplements, or drugs under
the Act. As with botanicals and probiotics, the classification of a
“functional food” under the Act is based primarily on the product’s
intended use and may also involve other factors, depending on the
elements of the statutory definition of a particular product category.

###### B. What Is “Energy Medicine?”

NCCAM considers energy medicine to involve energy fields of two types:
! Veritable energy fields, which can be measured and use either mechanical
vibrations (such as sound) or electromagnetic forces, including visible
light, magnetism, monochromatic radiation (such as laser light), and other
light rays; and
! Putative energy fields (or biofields) that have defied measurement to date
by reproducible methods. According to NCCAM, therapies involving
putative energy fields “are based on the concept that human beings are

to explain additional statutory or regulatory requirements or concepts, but those products are still “foods”
under the Act.


-----

## Page 120

infused with a subtle form of energy” and therapists “claim that they work
with this subtle energy, see it with their own eyes, and use it to effect
changes in the physical body and influence health.”[9]

In a sense, “conventional” medicine already uses various forms of “energy”
medicine.  For example, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device uses
electromagnetic waves to create images of internal body organs and tissues. As another
example, an ultrasound machine uses sound waves to create images of body organs,
tissues, and fetuses. Given their intended uses, we regulate these products as medical
devices under the Act.

CAM products that use veritable energy fields in the diagnosis of disease or other
conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or
animals or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or animals may be
medical devices under the Act.[10] Additionally, if the product is electronic and emits
radiation, it may be subject to additional requirements to ensure that there is no
unnecessary exposure of people to radiation.

CAM products that use putative energy fields in the diagnosis of disease or other
conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or
animals may be medical devices under the Act. For example, we regulate acupuncture
needles as “class II” medical devices.[11]

###### C. What Are “Manipulative and Body-Based Practices?”

According to NCCAM:

Under the umbrella of manipulative and body-based practices is a heterogeneous
group of CAM interventions and therapies. These include chiropractic and
osteopathic manipulation, massage therapy, Tui Na, reflexology, rolfing, Brown
technique, Trager bodywork, Alexander technique, Feldenkrais method, and a
host of others….

Manipulative and body-based practices focus primarily on the structures and
systems of the body, including the bones and joints, the soft tissues, and the
circulatory and lymphatic systems….[12]

To the extent that manipulative and body-based practices involve practitioners
physically manipulating a patient’s body, without using tools or machines, we do not

9  See NCCAM, “BACKGROUNDER – Energy Medicine: An Overview (August 2005), at page 1
(available at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.pdf) (accessed on November 22, 2005).
10  See section 201(h)(2) and (h)(3) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)(2) and (h)(3)) (definition of “device”).

(accessed on November 22, 2005).


-----

## Page 121

believe that such practices are subject to regulation under the Act or the PHS Act. If,
however, the manipulative and body-based practices involve the use of equipment (such
as massage devices) or the application of a product (such as a lotion, cream, or oil) to the
skin or other parts of the body, those products may be subject to regulation under the Act,
depending on the nature of the product and its intended use..

###### D. What Is “Mind-Body Medicine?”

NCCAM describes mind-body medicine as focusing on “the interactions among
the brain, mind, body, and behavior, and the powerful ways in which emotional, mental,
social, spiritual, and behavioral factors can directly affect health.”[13] It states that mindbody medicine “typically focuses on intervention strategies that are thought to promote
health, such as relaxation, hypnosis, visual imagery, meditation, yoga, biofeedback, tai
chi, qi gong, cognitive-behavioral therapies, group support, autogenic training, and
spirituality.”[14]

In general, CAM practices in this domain would not be subject to our jurisdiction
under the Act or the PHS Act. As with the manipulative and body-based practices
domain, however, any equipment or other products used as part of the practice of mindbody medicine may be subject to FDA regulation, depending on the nature of the product
and its intended use. For example, biofeedback machines intended to help a patient learn
to affect body functions, such as muscle activity, are regulated as class II devices.[15]

###### E. What Are “Whole Medical Systems?”

NCCAM describes whole medical systems as involving “complete systems of
theory and practice that have evolved independently from or parallel to allopathic
(conventional) medicine.”[16] These may reflect individual cultural systems, such as
traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine. Some elements common to whole
medical systems are a belief that the body has the power to heal itself, and that healing
may involve techniques that use the mind, body, and spirit.

Although it is unlikely that a whole medical system itself would be subject to
regulation under the Act or the PHS Act, products used as components of whole medical
systems may be subject to FDA regulation for the reasons described above.

###### III.  How Do CAM Domains Relate to Products That We Regulate?

Given the vast array of CAM products, practices, and therapies, it is impractical
for us to describe in detail how each one might be subject to regulation under the Act or
the PHS Act. Our intent, in part IV of this document, is two-fold:

! To indicate which CAM domains might be subject to regulation under the
Act or the PHS Act; and
! To show that neither the Act nor the PHS Act contains any exemption for
CAM products. In other words, if a product meets the statutory definition
of drug, device, biological product, food, etc., it will be subject to
regulation under the Act and/or the PHS Act.

###### IV.  What FDA Authority Might Apply to CAM Products?

 A. What Statutory Definitions Might Apply?

To understand how the Act or the PHS Act might apply to CAM products, we
begin by understanding the Act’s statutory definitions or, in the case of the PHS Act, our
authority regarding biological products.

###### 1. “Drug” and “New Drug”

Section 201(g)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)) defines the term “drug,” in
relevant part, to mean:

(A) articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopeia, official
Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States, or official National Formulary,
or any supplement to any of them; and (B) articles intended for use in the
diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other
animals; and (C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any
function of the body of man or other animals; and (D) articles intended for use as
a component of any articles specified in clause (A), (B), or (C).

Section 201(p) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) defines the term “new drug” to
mean:

(1) Any drug (except a new animal drug or an animal feed bearing or
containing a new animal drug) the composition of which is such that the drug is
not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and
experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and
effective[17] for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in

17  In Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott and Dunning, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 2483 (1973), the Supreme Court stated
that “general recognition” of effectiveness “requires at least ‘substantial evidence’ of effectiveness for
approval” of a new drug application (NDA). (An NDA is the marketing application for a new drug.)


-----

## Page 123

the labeling thereof, except that such a drug not so recognized shall not be
deemed to be a “new drug” if at any time prior to the enactment of this Act, it was
subject to the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, as amended, and if at such
time its labeling contained the same representations concerning the conditions of
use; or

(2) Any drug (except a new animal drug or an animal feed bearing or
containing a new animal drug) the composition of which is such that such drug, as
a result of investigations to determine its safety and effectiveness for use under
such conditions, has become so recognized, but which has not, otherwise than in
such investigations, been used to a material extent or for a material time under
such conditions.

To illustrate how these definitions might apply, consider an herbal product that is
intended to treat arthritis in humans. The herbal product, which would be a “biologically
based practice” insofar as CAM domains are concerned, would be a “drug” under section
201(g)(1)(B) of the Act because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
treatment, or prevention of disease (arthritis) in man. The same herbal product would
also be a “new drug” under section 201(p)(1) of the Act unless it is generally recognized,
among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed,
recommended, or suggested in the labeling. “New drug” status triggers the Act’s
requirements for premarket review and approval by FDA.[18]

A detailed discussion of the Act’s drug provisions is beyond the scope of this
guidance document. Note, however, that the Act imposes certain requirements (including
requirements pertaining to establishment registration and product listing, pre-market
approval, labeling, postmarket reporting, and good manufacturing practices) on those
who manufacture and distribute drugs. The Act and our drug regulations can be found at
our website at http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws.

2. “Device”

In general, section 201(h) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(h)) defines the term “device”
as:

an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro
reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or
accessory which is –

Section 505(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 355(d)) defines “substantial evidence” as “evidence consisting of
adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations conducted by experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the
basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug will have the
effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or
suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.” Thus, “general recognition” is a high standard.
18  Under section 505(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 355(a)), “No person shall introduce or deliver for
introduction into interstate commerce any new drug, unless an approval of an application filed pursuant to

[section 505(b) or 505(j) of the Act] is effective with respect to such drug.”


-----

## Page 124

(1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States
Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them,

(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in
the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals,
or

(3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or
other animals, and
which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action
within or on the body of man or other animals, and which is not dependent upon
being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.

To illustrate how a CAM product might be a “device” under the Act, acupuncture
is a CAM therapy that seeks to stimulate energy pathways (“meridians”) by puncturing,
pressing, heating, using electrical current, or using herbal medicines. Fine needles are
often used, and these acupuncture needles are “devices” under section 201(h) of the Act
because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
disease in man or are intended to affect the structure or function of the body of man. We
regulate acupuncture needles (see 21 CFR 880.5580), but not the practice of acupuncture
itself.

A detailed discussion of the Act’s device provisions is beyond the scope of this
guidance document. Note, however, that the Act establishes classifications for devices
(class I, II, or III) that affect how they are regulated. The Act also imposes certain
requirements on those who manufacture devices (including requirements pertaining to
establishment registration and product listing, pre-market review, labeling, postmarket
reporting, and good manufacturing practices). Certain requirements also apply to device
distributors. The Act and our device regulations can be found at our website at

###### 3. “Food”

Section 201(f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines the term “food” to mean
“articles used for food or drink for man or other animals,” chewing gum, and articles
used for components of any such article.

To illustrate how a CAM practice might involve “foods,” juice therapy uses juice
made from vegetables and fruits. Absent any claims that would make the juice subject to
the drug definition, the juice would be a “food” under section 201(f) of the Act because it
is an article used for food or drink for man.

A detailed discussion of the Act’s food provisions is beyond the scope of this
guidance document. However, anyone who intends to market CAM products that might
be subject to regulation under these provisions should familiarize himself/herself with the
Act’s requirements for foods, particularly with respect to safety and labeling. The Act
and our food regulations can be found at our website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws.

###### 4. “Food Additive”

Section 201(s) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)) defines the term “food additive” to
mean, in part, “any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be
expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise
affecting the characteristics of any food….if such substance is not generally recognized,
among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety, as
having been adequately shown through scientific procedures (or, in the case of a
substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through either scientific procedures or
experience based on common use in food) to be safe under the conditions of its intended
use….”[19]

To illustrate how a CAM product might involve “food additives” under section
201(s) of the Act, some CAM practices involve dietary modifications where substances
such as botanicals or enzymes are added to foods in the diet. If a manufacturer adds such
a substance to a food, the substance may fall within the “food additive” definition at
section 201(s) of the Act. A food additive is subject to premarket approval by FDA
under section 409 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 348). Food additives that we have not approved
or that do not comply with applicable FDA regulations prescribing safe conditions of use
are deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the Act, and foods that contain such
additives are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)).
The Act provides that a substance is exempt from the definition of a food additive and
thus, from pre-market approval, if, among other reasons, it is generally recognized as safe
(GRAS) by qualified experts under the conditions of intended use. Whether a substance
added to a food is considered to be a food additive or is GRAS, any claims associating
the substance with the reduction of a disease risk are “health claims” (defined in 21 CFR
101.14(a)(1)) that require premarket review by FDA.[20]

A detailed discussion of the Act’s food additive provisions is beyond the scope of
this guidance document. However, anyone intending to market CAM products that are or
contain substances that might be subject to regulation as food additives should familiarize
himself/herself with the Act’s food additive requirements. The Act and our food additive
regulations can be found at our website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws.

###### 5. “Dietary Supplement”

Section 201(ff) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)) defines the term “dietary
supplement” as follows:

The term “dietary supplement” 
19  The statutory definition of “food additive” exempts certain substances, such as pesticide chemical
residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, pesticide chemicals, color additives,
dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement (as defined in section 201(ff) of the Act),
and new animal drugs.
20 See 21 CFR 101.70.


-----

## Page 126

(1) means a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that
bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients:

(A) a vitamin;
(B) a mineral;
(C) an herb or other botanical;
(D) an amino acid;
(E) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by
increasing the total dietary intake; or
(F) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any
ingredient described in clause (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E);
(2) means a product that

(A) (i) is intended for ingestion in a form described in section
411(c)(1)(B)(i); or
(ii) complies with section 411(c)(1)(B)(ii);
(B) is not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a
meal or the diet; and
(C) is labeled as a dietary supplement; and
(3) does-
(A) include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 or
licensed as a biologic under section 351 of the Public Health Service
Act (42 U.S.C. 262) and was, prior to such approval, certification, or
license, marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food unless the
Secretary has issued a regulation, after notice and comment, finding
that the article, when used as or in a dietary supplement under the
conditions of use and dosages set forth in the labeling for such dietary
supplement, is unlawful under section 402(f); and
(B) does not include—

(i) an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505,
certified as an antibiotic under section 507, or licensed as a biologic
under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262),
or
(ii) an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or
biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been
instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been
made public,
which was not before such approval, certification, licensing, or
authorization marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food unless the
Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, has issued a regulation, under
notice and comment, finding that the article would be lawful under this
Act.
Except for purposes of section 201(g) [of the Act], a dietary supplement shall be
deemed to be a food within the meaning of this Act.

To illustrate how a CAM product might be a “dietary supplement” under section
201(ff) of the Act, consider botanical products used in naturopathy. (Naturopathy is a
CAM whole medical system that views disease as a manifestation of alterations in the


-----

## Page 127

processes by which the body heals itself.[21]) For example, naturopathic cranberry tablets
might be labeled for use to maintain the health of the urinary tract. In this example, the
cranberry tablets generally would be regulated as “dietary supplements” under section
201(ff)(1) of the Act if they were labeled for use to “maintain the health of the urinary
tract” rather than “prevent urinary tract infections.” The cranberry tablets would be
regulated as “drugs” under section 201(g) of the Act if they were labeled for use to “treat
urinary tract infections” even if they were labeled as dietary supplements.

A detailed discussion of the Act’s dietary supplement provisions is beyond the
scope of this guidance document. However, anyone intending to market CAM products
that might be subject to regulation as a dietary supplement should familiarize
himself/herself with the Act’s dietary supplement requirements, particularly with respect
to safety and labeling. The Act and our dietary supplement regulations can be found at
our website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws.

###### 6. “Cosmetic”

Section 201(i) of the Act defines the term “cosmetic” to mean “(1) articles
intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise
applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting
attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and (2) articles intended for use as a component
of any such articles; except that such term shall not include soap.”

It is possible that certain products used in conjunction with CAM practices may
be “cosmetics” under the Act. For example, if a CAM practice involves massage with a
moisturizer, the moisturizer could be a “cosmetic” to the extent that it is “rubbed, poured,
sprinkled, or sprayed on” the body for beautification or appearance-altering purposes.
However, if the moisturizer’s intended use is also for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body,
then it may also be subject to regulation as a drug. Other examples of drug/cosmetic
combinations are deodorants that are also antiperspirants, moisturizers and makeup
marketed with sun-protection claims, and shampoos that also treat dandruff.

The Act does not require premarket approval for cosmetics, but it does prohibit
the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce. Anyone
intending to market CAM products that might be subject to regulation as cosmetics
should familiarize himself/herself with the safety and labeling requirements for these
products in the Act and our regulations. The Act and our cosmetic regulations can be
[found at our website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws.](http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws)

21  See NCCAM, “BACKGROUNDER: Whole Medical Systems: An Overview” (October 2004) at pages
3-4.

## Page 128

###### 7. “Biological Product”

Section 351(a)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(1)) states, in part, that no
person “shall introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any
biological product” unless that product has an effective license and its package is plainly
marked with the product’s proper name, the name, address, and applicable license
number of the biological product’s manufacturer, and the product’s expiration date.
Section 351(a)(2) of the PHS Act gives us the authority to establish requirements for the
approval, suspension, and revocation of biological product licenses.

Section 351(i) of the PHS Act defines “biological product” as “a virus,
therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative,
allergenic product, or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of arsphenamine
(or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention,
treatment, or cure of a disease or condition in human beings.” The term “virus” captures
a broad spectrum of microorganisms that cause an infectious disease and includes, but is
not limited to, filterable viruses, bacteria, rickettsia, fungi, and protozoa (see 21 CFR
600.3(h)(1)).

It is conceivable that some “biologically based practices” (as defined by
NCCAM) could involve the use of “biological products” as defined by section 351(i) of
the PHS Act. For example, the bacteria used in a probiotic product could make the
product a “biological product” subject to the PHS Act.

A detailed discussion of biological product regulation under the PHS Act is
beyond the scope of this guidance document. Note, however, that in addition to our
authority under section 351 of the PHS Act, section 361 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 264)
authorizes us to make and enforce regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission,
or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions,
or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.” If a CAM product
manufacturer attempted to use a live, disease-causing virus as a component of a CAM
product, we could exercise our authority under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR
1240.30 to take action against the product, in addition to consider the applicability of
section 351 of the PHS Act. The PHS Act and FDA’s regulations for biological products
can be found at our website at www.fda.gov/opacom/laws.

###### Guidance for Industry[1] Cosmetic Good Manufacturing Practices

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA’s) current thinking on this
topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the telephone number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

###### I. Introduction

This document provides guidance to industry and other stakeholders (e.g., consumer interest
groups, academia, other regulatory groups) on FDA’s current thinking concerning what
constitutes Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for cosmetics. It is intended to assist industry
and other stakeholders in identifying the standards and issues that can affect the quality of
cosmetic products.

This guidance revises the “Cosmetic Good Manufacturing (GMP) Guidelines/Inspection
Checklist” by updating it to set forth current practice, and clarify certain topic areas based on
recent experience. In addition, as part of an international harmonization effort with the
International Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulations (ICCR), FDA (or we) agreed to consider the
current International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for cosmetic GMPs (ISO
22716:2007) when revising this guidance. We reviewed ISO 22716 and decided to incorporate,
modify, or exclude specific aspects of it into this guidance based on our experience.

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

###### II. Background

The predecessor to this guidance, FDA’s “Cosmetic Good Manufacturing Guidelines/Inspection
Checklist,” was based on documents and information dating before the early 1990’s. Much of
the material in the predecessor document has become outdated. In addition, there has been a
great deal of progress in developing international consensus standards for cosmetics, specifically

1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Cosmetics and Colors in the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.


-----

## Page 133

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

ISO 22716 (Cosmetics – Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) – Guidelines on Good
_Manufacturing Practices. ISO 22716:2007. Geneva, Switzerland:ISO.)._

ISO is a non-governmental organization that develops and publishes international consensus
standards. In September 2007, the International Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulation (ICCR),
the quadrilateral international harmonization group, met in Belgium. During that meeting, the
regulators from the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Japan agreed that it would
be useful for the cosmetic industry to have a standardized scheme for GMPs that could apply to
their jurisdictions. As a result, the regulators from these four jurisdictions agreed to take ISO
standards for cosmetic GMPs into consideration when developing or updating guidelines or other
measures addressing GMPs (See International Cooperation on Cosmetic Regulation: Outcome of
Meeting, September 26-28, 2007). In developing this guidance, FDA has incorporated elements
of ISO 22716, as appropriate, and consistent with FDA regulations.

###### III. Discussion
 A. Overview

The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) prohibits the introduction, or
delivery for introduction, into interstate commerce of cosmetics that are adulterated or
misbranded (Section 301 of the FD&C Act).

If you manufacture cosmetics, you can reduce the risk of adulterating or misbranding cosmetics
by following the GMP recommendations in this guidance. By following these recommendations,
you can effectively conduct a self-inspection to rate your operations.

Tampering and other malicious, criminal, or terrorist activity present additional risks that can
also have a direct impact on your products’ quality. To help minimize these risks to cosmetics
under your control, we recommend that you consult a separate FDA guidance document entitled
“Guidance for Industry: Cosmetic Processors and Transporters of Cosmetics Security Preventive
Measures Guidance.”

###### B. Definitions

We recommend that you refer to the FD&C Act and Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(21 CFR) for definitions of the terms “cosmetic” (Section 201(i) of the FD&C Act) and “tamperresistant packaging” (21 CFR 700.25). In addition, the following terms apply to this guidance:

**Documentation: 1) The supplying of documents or supporting references; use of documentary**
evidence; 2) the documents or references thus supplied; 3) the collecting, abstracting, and coding
of printed or written information for future reference. (“documentation,” Webster’s New World
Dictionary Third College Edition, 1988 ed.).


-----

## Page 134

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

**Good manufacturing practice (GMP): That part of quality assurance aimed at ensuring that**
products are consistently manufactured to a quality appropriate to their intended use. It is thus
concerned with both manufacturing and quality control procedures. (Sharp, John, Good
Manufacturing Practice, Philosophy and Applications, Buffalo Grove, IL: Interpharm Press,
1991, pg. 47.).

**Internal Audit: Systematic and independent examination made by competent personnel inside**
the company, the aim of which is to determine whether activities covered by these guidelines and
related results comply with planned arrangements and whether these arrangements are
implemented effectively and are suitable for achieving objectives. (Cosmetics – Good
_Manufacturing Practices (GMP) – Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, ISO_
22716:2007, Geneva, Switzerland: ISO.).

**Standard operating procedure (SOP): Instructions on how to perform tasks and descriptions**
of the approved or required procedures for accomplishing specific quality assurance objectives.
(Garfield. F.M., Klesta, E., and Hirsch, J., eds., Quality Assurance Principles for Analytical
Laboratories, 3[rd] Ed., Gaithersburg, MD: AOAC International, 2000, pg. 26).

###### C. Specific Guidance for Cosmetics[2]

**Documentation**

Documentation creates a mechanism that shows how products are manufactured and tested.
Documentation should define your organization’s processes and capture every aspect of your
manufacturing process. Documentation prevents errors of interpretation or loss of information
that may result from reliance on verbal communication. Documentation also allows you to trace
where any problems may have occurred and to take appropriate corrective action.

**Records**

Records should be retained in either paper or electronic format. Records should capture in detail
the operations, procedures, deviations from procedures, justifications, instructions (including
training), specifications, protocols, reports, methods, precautions, corrections and other measures,
and other appropriate information related to GMPs.

You should review raw material records to determine if raw material is adequately controlled.
These records may include origin, receipt, examination, testing, disposition, and use records.

You should determine whether disposition of rejected materials or returned goods is documented.
(For example, reworking operations, returns to suppliers, and disposals).

You should evaluate batch production control records, which should include:

2 There are no GMP regulations for cosmetics.


-----

## Page 135

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

    - Documentation of all ingredients (name, code, lot number, quantity, etc.) added to the
batch

    - Documentation of all production steps (for example, processing, handling, transferring,
holding, and filling)

    - In-process sampling, controlling, and adjusting steps

    - Batch and finished product lot or control numbers

    - The finished products control status – accepted or rejected

You should evaluate laboratory control records for raw materials, in-process materials, and
finished products. These records should include documentation of sampling procedures, test
results, and interpretation of the test results (accepts or reject).

You should determine if records are adequate to conduct an effective recall. Initial distribution
records identifying the consignee, the product, and the lot or control number should be retained.

You should determine if records are developed in a timely manner after an event occurs.

**Buildings and Facilities**

You should determine whether the buildings and facilities used for manufacturing are of suitable
size, design, and construction, and maintained in a clean and orderly manner. Buildings should
provide:

    - Space of sufficient size and adequate organization to prevent selection errors (i.e., mixups) or cross contamination between consumables, raw materials, intermediate
formulations (i.e., in-process materials), and finished products (This applies to
containers, closures, labels and labeling materials as well.)

    - Adequate filth and pest controls (Examples of filth may include any objectionable
matter, contributed by animal contamination such as rodent, insect, or bird matter; or any
other objectionable matter contributed by insanitary conditions.)

    - Floors, walls, and ceilings constructed of smooth, easily cleanable surfaces

    - Adequate lighting and ventilation, and, if necessary for control purposes, screening,
filtering, dust, humidity, temperature, and bacteriological controls

    - Adequate washing, cleaning, plumbing, toilet, and locker facilities to allow for sanitary
operation; cleaning of facilities, equipment, and utensils; and personal cleanliness; and

    - Fixtures, ducts, pipes, and drainages installed to prevent condensate or drip
contamination

**Equipment**

You should determine whether equipment and utensils used in processing, holding, transferring
and packaging are of appropriate design, size, material and workmanship for the intended purpose
to prevent corrosion, accumulation of static material and/or adulteration with lubricants, coolants,
dirt, and sanitizing agents. The equipment (for example, utensils, pipework, cosmetic contact
surfaces, and balances) should be:


-----

## Page 136

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

  - Maintained in a clean and orderly condition, sanitized at appropriate times, and stored in a
manner that protects against splash, dust, and other contaminants

  - Constructed to facilitate adjustment, cleaning, and maintenance

  - Of suitable size and accuracy for measuring, mixing, and weighing operations

  - Calibrated regularly or checked according to an SOP with results documented, where
appropriate

  - Removed from use if it is defective, does not meet recommended tolerances, or cannot be
repaired and calibrated immediately

**Personnel**

You should determine whether personnel supervising or performing cosmetics manufacturing or
control have the education, training, and/or experience to perform their assigned functions. In
addition:

  - Personnel coming in direct contact with cosmetic raw materials, in-process materials,
finished products, or contact surfaces should wear clean clothing appropriate for the duties
they perform and necessary protective apparel (for example, uniforms, gloves, safety
glasses, and hair restraints).

  - Personnel should also maintain adequate personnel cleanliness, and be free from abnormal
sources of microbiological contamination (for example, sores and infected wounds)

  - Eating food, drinking beverages, or using tobacco should be restricted to appropriate
designated areas away from storage and processing areas

  - All personnel and visitors should be properly supervised while in the manufacturing
facility; and

  - Only authorized personnel should be allowed access into production, storage, and product
control areas

**Raw Materials**

You should determine whether raw materials are identified, stored, examined, tested, inventoried,
handled, and controlled to ensure they conform to appropriate standards and specifications. In
particular, raw materials should be:

  - Stored and handled to prevent mistakes (i.e., mix-ups or selection errors), contamination
with microorganisms or other chemicals, and degradation from exposure to excessive
environmental conditions (e.g., heat, cold, sunlight, moisture, etc.)

  - Held in closed containers and stored off the floor

  - Maintained in containers that are labeled with the identity, lot number, and control status
(release or quarantine)

  - Sampled and tested for conformance with specifications and to ensure the absence of filth,
microorganisms, and other adulterants prior to processing or usage (Animal and vegetable
origin materials and those produced by cold processing methods should be reviewed for
filth and/or microorganism contamination.); and

  - Properly identified and controlled to prevent the use of materials that fail to meet
acceptance specifications


-----

## Page 137

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

_Water_

You should determine whether:

  - The water used as a cosmetic ingredient is used as-is (i.e., directly from the tap) or if it has
been treated before being used (i.e., has it been treated by such means as deionization,
distillation, or reverse osmosis)

  - There are established procedures for ensuring that the water used as a cosmetic ingredient

     - Is of a defined quality

     - Is not affected by materials used in the water treatment equipment

     - Is being tested or monitored regularly to verify that it meets applicable chemical,
physical, and microbiological specifications for quality; and

     - The entire system for supplying water used as a cosmetic ingredient is set up to
avoid stagnation and risks of contamination (This system should be routinely
cleaned and sanitized according to an appropriate SOP that ensures no biofilm
build-up.)

_Color Additives_

You should determine whether color additives are approved for use in your specific cosmetic
products (21 CFR parts 73, 74, and 82). Should an unlisted color additive be an ingredient of the
cosmetic, approval of a petition for a new color additive is required pursuant to 21 CFR parts 70
and 71. A summary chart for color additives can be found on FDA’s website. Color additives
subject to certification must be labeled with the lot number assigned by the Color Certification
Branch[3] (21 CFR 70.25(d)) (see exception below[4]).

_Prohibited and Restricted Cosmetic Ingredients_

Certain ingredients are prohibited from use in cosmetic products marketed in the United States;
others have restrictions on their use. Ingredients whose use is prohibited or restricted are listed in
the tables below.

In addition to the prohibited and restricted ingredients listed in the following tables, you should
check the CFR, specifically 21 CFR part 700, Subpart B, for any additional requirements regarding
specific cosmetic products or their ingredients that may have been added to FDA’s regulations.

3 The Color Certification Branch is located in the Office of Cosmetics and Colors in the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
4 Color additives must be labeled with the lot number assigned by the Color Certification Branch, except in the case
of any mixture for household use which contains not more than 15 percent of pure color and which is in packages
containing not more than 3 ounces there appears on the label, a code number which the manufacturer has identified
with the lot number by giving to the FDA written notice that such code number will be used in lieu of the lot number
(21 CFR 70.25(d)).

**Production**

You should determine whether written manufacturing and control SOPs have been established (for
example, formulations, processing instructions, in-process control methods, packaging instructions,
instructions for operating equipment).  Procedures should include provisions to ensure that:

    - The selection, weighing, and measuring of raw materials and the determination of
finished yield are reviewed by a second individual

    - Major equipment, transfer lines, containers and tanks used for processing, holding, or
filling are identified to indicate contents, batch identification/designation, stage of
processing and control status

    - There are appropriate measures to prevent contamination with microorganisms,
chemicals, filth, or other extraneous material

    - There are in-process controls to ensure product uniformity, integrity (for example, inprocess batch weights), accurate fill of mixing containers, and adequacy of mixing.

    - The theoretical yield for a production batch is compared with the actual yield

    - The tamper-resistant packaging and labeling for liquid oral hygiene products and
vaginal products meet the requirements of 21 CFR 700.25

    - The storage and handling of packaging materials that are intended to come into direct
contact with the product prevent selection errors and microbiological or chemical
contamination; and

    - Finished product packages bear permanent meaningful, unique lot or control numbers
and you have a coding system that corresponds to these numbers

**Laboratory Controls**

You should evaluate laboratory controls including sample collection techniques, specifications, test
methods, laboratory equipment, and technician qualifications. Laboratory controls should include
provisions to ensure that:

    - Raw materials (including water), in-process and finished product samples are tested or
examined for identity and compliance with applicable specifications (for example,

|Prohibited Cosmetic Ingredients|CFR Citation|
|---|---|
|Bithional|21 CFR 700.11|
|Vinyl chloride|21 CFR 700.14|
|Certain halogenated salicylanilides|21 CFR 700.15|
|Zirconium in aerosol products|21 CFR 700.16|
|Chloroform|21 CFR 700.18|
|Methylene chloride|21 CFR 700.19|
|Chlorofluorocarbon propellants|21 CFR 700.23|
|Prohibited cattle material|21 CFR 700.27|

|Restricted Cosmetic Ingredients|CFR Citation|

physical and chemical properties), microbial contamination, and hazards or other
chemical contamination

    - Samples are representative of the lot

    - Current finished product samples as well as retained product samples are tested for
adequacy of preservation against microbial contamination under reasonable conditions
of storage and use

    - Samples of approved lots of raw materials and finished products are retained for an
adequate time period

    - Retained samples are stored under conditions which protect their integrity (for example,
to avoid contamination and deterioration), and are retested at appropriate intervals to
assure continued compliance with established specifications; and

    - Returned cosmetics are examined for deterioration, contamination, and compliance
with acceptance specifications

**Internal Audit**

You should determine whether effective procedures for internal audits are followed. At a
minimum, internal audit procedures should provide that:

    - Internal audits occur regularly or on demand

    - Internal audits are conducted by individuals who do not have direct responsibility for
the matters being audited

    - All observations made during the internal audit are evaluated and shared with
appropriate management, production, quality control, and/or lab personnel; and

    - Internal audit follow-up confirms the satisfactory completion or implementation of
corrective actions

**Complaints, Adverse Events, and Recalls**

You should review product complaints, consumer adverse event reports, and product recall files
and determine the following:

    - For complaints:
Whether there are SOPs for reporting, recording, filing, evaluating, and following up on
both written and oral complaints

    - For complaints alleging adverse events involving bodily injury:

       - The kind and severity of each reported injury

       - The body part involved

       - Product and code numbers

       - Whether medical treatment was sought, and, if so, the nature of the medical
treatment and the name of the attending physician or other healthcare
professional

       - Whether resolution of the event occurred, with or without long-term or
persistent effects (If long-term or persistent effects occurred, the nature of those
effects)

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

    - The name(s) and location(s) of any poison control center, government agency,
physicians group, etc., to whom formula information and/or toxicity data has
been provided; and

    - Whether you are voluntarily reporting adverse events to FDA through the
MedWatch program

- For voluntary product recalls, the guidelines in 21 CFR part 7, Subpart C, should be
considered, including:

    - Whether there is a proposed strategy for conducting a recall

    - Whether recall notifications are capable of being initiated promptly

    - Whether the appropriate FDA district office has been notified of recalls

    - Whether recalled products have been identified and stored separately in a secure
area until the firm has made a decision about the proper disposition or
correction consistent with the degree of risk of the recalled product; and

    - Whether FDA’s guidance as outlined in 21 CFR 7.59 has been considered

##### Registration and Listing of Cosmetic Product Facilities and Products: Guidance for Industry[1]

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA
or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible
for this guidance as listed on the title page.

###### I. Introduction

This guidance provides recommendations and instructions to assist persons submitting cosmetic
product facility registrations and product listings to FDA. This guidance document explains,
among other things:

  - The statutory requirement to submit cosmetic product facility registrations and product
listings;

  - Definitions;

  - Who is responsible for making the submissions;

  - What information to include in the submissions;

  - How to make the submissions; and

  - When to make the submissions.

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

###### II. Background

On December 29, 2022, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Pub. L.
117-328) into law, which included the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022
(MoCRA). Among other provisions, MoCRA added section 607 to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), establishing requirements for cosmetic product facility registration
and product listing.

1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Cosmetics and Colors, in the Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition, and the Office of the Chief Scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.


-----

## Page 144

Section 607(a) of the FD&C Act requires every person that owns or operates a facility that
“engages in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United
States” to register each facility with FDA.

Section 607(c) of the FD&C Act requires that for each cosmetic product, the responsible person
must submit to FDA “a cosmetic product listing.”

FDA previously had a voluntary cosmetic registration program (see 21 CFR Parts 710 and 720).
FDA ended its voluntary registration program as of March 27, 2023, while we worked toward
establishing a new system, including a submission portal for the cosmetic product facility
registrations and product listings mandated by MoCRA.[2] Information in the voluntary cosmetic
registration program will not be transferred to this new system. Because the information in the
voluntary cosmetic registration program differs from the information required to be submitted
under MoCRA, FDA does not consider previous submissions to the voluntary cosmetic
registration program to satisfy the registration and listing requirements mandated by MoCRA.

FDA has developed an electronic submission portal, Cosmetics Direct, to help streamline
submission and receipt of registration and product listing information under section 607 of the
FD&C Act. FDA has developed paper forms (FDA Form 5066 and 5067) as an alternative
submission tool. As an additional alternative, users may transmit submissions through FDA’s
Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) as described in section III.E. below. FDA strongly
encourages electronic submissions to facilitate efficiency and timeliness of data submission and
management for the agency. Cosmetics Direct, technical assistance documents and paper
submission forms can be accessed at: [https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/registration-listing-](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/registration-listing-cosmetic-product-facilities-and-products)
[cosmetic-product-facilities-and-products.](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/registration-listing-cosmetic-product-facilities-and-products)

Certain small businesses, as defined in section 612 of the FD&C Act, are not required to register
facilities and list cosmetic product(s) (refer to section III.A. and III.B. below).

Failure to register or submit listing information in accordance with section 607 of the FD&C Act
is a prohibited act under section 301(hhh) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(hhh)).

###### III. Questions and Answers
 A. What definitions apply?

We plan to use the following definitions in implementing the registration and product listing
requirements of section 607 of the FD&C Act:

[Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP)” at: https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-has-](https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-has-stopped-accepting-submissions-voluntary-cosmetic-registration-program-vcrp)
[stopped-accepting-submissions-voluntary-cosmetic-registration-program-vcrp.](https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-has-stopped-accepting-submissions-voluntary-cosmetic-registration-program-vcrp)

## Page 145

_CONTRACT MANUFACTURER. — means a facility that manufactures or processes a cosmetic_
product on behalf of another entity.

_COSMETIC PRODUCT. — as defined in section 604(2) of the FD&C Act, means a preparation_
of cosmetic ingredients with a qualitatively and quantitatively set composition for use in a
finished product.

_DUNS NUMBER. — The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is a unique nine-_
digit identification number provided by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). The DUNS Number is sitespecific. Therefore, each distinct physical location of an entity (such as branches, divisions, and
headquarters) may be assigned a DUNS number.

_FACILITY. — as defined in section 604(3) of the FD&C Act, includes any establishment_
(including an establishment of an importer) that manufactures or processes cosmetic products
distributed in the United States.

This term does not include any of the following:

(i) Beauty shops and salons, unless such establishment manufactures or processes
cosmetic products at that location;

(ii) Cosmetic product retailers, including individual sales representatives, direct sellers
(as defined in section 3508(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), retail
distribution facilities, and pharmacies, unless such establishment manufactures or
processes cosmetic products that are not sold directly to consumers at that location;

(iii) Hospitals, physicians’ offices, and health care clinics;

(iv) Public health agencies and other nonprofit entities that provide cosmetic products
directly to the consumer;

(v) Entities (such as hotels and airlines) that provide complimentary cosmetic products to
customers incidental to other services;

(vi) Trade shows and other venues where cosmetic product samples are provided free of
charge;

(vii) An establishment that manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are solely
for use in research or evaluation, including for production testing and not offered for
retail sale;

(viii) An establishment that solely performs one or more of the following with respect to
cosmetic products:

     - Labeling,

     - Relabeling,

     - Packaging,

     - Repackaging,

     - Holding,

     - Distributing.


-----

## Page 146

For purposes of determining whether an establishment solely performs one or more of the
activities listed under (viii), the terms ‘packaging’ and ‘repackaging’ do not include filling a
product container with a cosmetic product.

_FEI. — is an acronym which stands for FDA Establishment Identifier. It is also known as the_
Firm or Facility Establishment Identifier. The FEI number is a unique identifier assigned by the
FDA to identify firms associated with FDA-regulated products. FDA intends to use a facility’s
FEI number as the cosmetic product facility’s registration number.

_MANUFACTURING OR PROCESSING OF A COSMETIC PRODUCT. — means engaging in_
one or more steps in the making of any cosmetic product by chemical, physical, biological, or
other procedures, including manipulation, sampling, testing, or control procedures applied to the
product.

_OPERATOR. — means a person, as defined in section 201(e) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C_
321(e)), who has management authority over an establishment.

_OWNER. — means a person, as defined in section 201(e) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(e)),_
who has an ownership interest in an establishment.

_RESPONSIBLE PERSON. — as defined in section 604(4) of the FD&C Act, means the_
manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a cosmetic product whose name appears on the label of
such cosmetic product in accordance with section 609(a) of the FD&C Act or section 4(a) of the
Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.

_SMALL BUSINESSES. — as defined in section 612 of the FD&C Act, means responsible_
persons, and owners and operators of facilities, whose average gross annual sales in the U.S. of
cosmetic products for the previous 3-year period is less than $1,000,000, adjusted for inflation,[3]
and who do not engage in the manufacturing or processing of certain cosmetic products
described in section 612(b) of the FD&C Act. A small business is exempt from the registration
and listing requirements.

Under section 612(b) of the FD&C Act, regardless of their average gross annual sales,
businesses that engage in the manufacturing or processing of the following are not
exempt from the registration and listing requirements:

     - Cosmetic products that regularly come into contact with mucus membrane of the
eye under conditions of use that are customary or usual;

     - Cosmetic products that are injected;

     - Cosmetic products that are intended for internal use; or

3 We recommend using the Implicit Price Deflator for GDP, updated annually by the Bureau of Economic Analysis,
when adjusting for inflation. Please refer to:
[https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&1921=survey&1903=13.](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&1921=survey&1903=13)

## Page 147

     - Cosmetic products that are intended to alter appearance for more than 24 hours
under conditions of use that are customary or usual and removal by the consumer
is not part of such conditions of use that are customary or usual.

###### B. Who registers a facility and submits product listing information under section 607 of the FD&C Act?

**1. Registration of a Facility**

Section 607(a)(1) of the FD&C Act requires every person that owns or operates a facility that
engages in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the
United States to register each facility, except in the following instances:

    - A facility that is exempt from registration as a “small business” as described section
III.A. above;

    - A facility that is also subject to the requirements in chapter V of the FD&C Act (for
drugs and devices) unless the facility also manufactures or processes cosmetic
products that are not subject to the requirements of chapter V of the FD&C Act (see
section 613 of the FD&C Act).

As provided under section 607(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, if a facility manufactures or processes
cosmetic products on behalf of a responsible person (i.e., a contract manufacturer), only a
single registration is required for such facility even if the facility is manufacturing or
processing its own cosmetic products or cosmetic products on behalf of more than one
responsible person. A responsible person whose products are manufactured or processed at
such facility may submit the facility registration for such facility. Under this approach, an
owner or operator of a contract manufacturing facility would not register such facility if the
responsible person submitted the facility registration.

**2. Product Listing**

Section 607(c) of the FD&C Act requires that for each cosmetic product, the responsible
person must submit a cosmetic product listing, or ensure such submission is made, except in
the following instances:

    - The responsible person that is exempt as a “small business” as described in section
III.A. above;

    - The cosmetic product that is also subject to the requirements in chapter V of the
FD&C Act (for drugs and devices). For example, if the product is both a drug and a
cosmetic product under the FD&C Act, a cosmetic product listing is not required to
be submitted for such product (see section 613 of the FD&C Act), but the listed
product should be identified as both a drug and a cosmetic in the drug listing
submission.


-----

## Page 148

###### C. What information is submitted as part of facility registration and product listing under section 607 of the FD&C Act?

**1. Registration**

Under sections 607(a) and 607(b)(2) of the FD&C Act, the following information must be
submitted in a facility registration:

    - the name of the owner and/or operator of the facility;

    - the facility’s name, physical address, email address, and telephone number;

    - with respect to any foreign facility, the contact for the United States agent[4] of the
facility (name and phone number), and, if available, the electronic contact
information (email);

    - the facility registration number, if any, previously assigned by FDA;[5]

    - all brand names under which cosmetic products manufactured or processed in the
facility are sold;

    - the product category or categories (refer to Appendix A below) and responsible
person for each cosmetic product manufactured or processed at the facility; and

    - type of submission (initial, amended, biennial renewal, or abbreviated renewal, for
further information see discussion in section III.F.1).

Obtaining the assigned facility registration number is the first step before starting the
registration submission.

FDA also requests that the following additional optional information be submitted:

4 With respect to a foreign facility, a United States agent (“U.S. agent”) is required for registration purposes. The
U.S. agent is the person, which includes an individual or business entity, that resides in the U.S. or maintains a U.S.
place of business and is physically present in the U.S. A U.S. agent should not be a mailbox, answering machine or
service, or other place where an individual acting as the foreign facility’s agent is not physically present.
5 The facility registration number is the FDA Establishment Identifier (FEI). To facilitate the registration process,
the owner or operator of a facility will need to obtain an FEI number before submitting the facility registration.
Request for issuance of FEI numbers associated with registration for cosmetic product facilities are typically
processed in 7-10 business days. A facility that was previously assigned an FEI number in connection with other
business with FDA should use the same FEI number and should not request a new FEI. For more information,
including how to determine if an entity already has an FEI number, refer to the webpage at:
[https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/feiportal/index.cfm?action=portal.login. If your entity does not have an FEI](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/feiportal/index.cfm?action=portal.login)
number assigned by FDA, send a request to feiportal@fda.hhs.gov and provide the following information:

  - Legal firm name

  - Any alternate firm names, including those used for "doing business as" purposes

  - Physical address

  - Designated mailing address

  - Name and contact information of the designated contact person

  - A comprehensive list of activities conducted at this specific location (e.g., drug manufacturing, food
packaging, etc.)

  - Any registration numbers associated with other FDA Center(s), if applicable

  - Any former names the firm was known by

  - Any previous addresses linked to the firm


-----

## Page 149

    - parent company name (if applicable);

    - facility DUNS Number; and

    - additional contact information for individuals associated with the registration.

In addition, FDA requests that individuals submitting registration and listing information to
attest to the accuracy and veracity of the information submitted.

**2. Product Listing**

Under section 607(c) of the FD&C Act, the following information must be submitted in a
cosmetic product listing:

    - the facility registration number of each facility where the cosmetic product is
manufactured or processed;[6]

    - the name and contact number of the responsible person and the name for the cosmetic
product, as such name appears on the label;

    - the applicable cosmetic category or categories for the cosmetic product (refer to
Appendix A below);

    - a list of ingredients in the cosmetic product, including any fragrances, flavors, or
colors, with each ingredient identified by the name, as required under section 701.3 of
title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), or by the
common or usual name of the ingredient;

    - the product listing number, if any previously assigned; and

    - type of submission (initial, update to content (annual), abbreviated renewal).

Under section 607(c)(4)(B), a single listing submission for a cosmetic product may include
multiple cosmetic products with identical formulations, or formulations that differ only with
respect to colors, fragrances or flavors, or quantity of contents.

FDA also requests that the following additional optional information be submitted:

    - parent company name (if applicable);

    - type of business (as listed on the label), i.e., manufacturer, packer, or distributor;

    - image of the label (currently jpg files are accepted);

    - product webpage link;

    - whether the cosmetic product is for professional use only;

    - responsible person DUNS Number for address listed on product label;

    - Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNIIs)[7]; and

6 The responsible person will need to obtain the relevant facility registration number(s) for each facility where its
cosmetic products are manufactured or processed, because the facility registration number(s) is required for the
product listing submission. If the facility is exempt from registration, for example because it is a small business, and
has no facility registration number, then facility name/address can be provided instead.
7 [For more information and to search for UNIIs please refer to the webpage at: https://precision.fda.gov/uniisearch.](https://precision.fda.gov/uniisearch)

    - additional contact information for individuals associated with the listing.

In addition, FDA requests that individuals submitting registration and listing information
attest to the accuracy and veracity of the information submitted.

###### D. Is cosmetic product facility registration and cosmetic product listing information submitted under section 607 of the FD&C Act available for public disclosure?

The product listing number will not be available for public disclosure (section 607(d) of the
FD&C Act). Further, under section 607(e) of the FD&C Act, FDA will not disclose information
from a facility registration on the brand names under which cosmetic products manufactured or
processed in the facility are sold, or from a product listing on the facility registration number of
the facility where the cosmetic product is manufactured or processed, in response to a request
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552). All other information from
cosmetic product facility registration and listing would be available for public disclosure
consistent with the FOIA, FDA’s disclosure regulations under 21 CFR Part 20, and other
applicable federal law. FDA intends to make relevant information from cosmetic product facility
registration and listing available to the public to the extent permitted by law.

###### E. How do you submit registration and product listing information required under section 607 of the FD&C Act?

Cosmetics Direct is an electronic submission portal designed to help streamline submission and
receipt of registration and product listing information required by section 607 of the FD&C Act.
While electronic submission is not required, FDA strongly encourages electronic submissions to
facilitate efficiency and timeliness of data submission and management for the agency.
Registration and listing data are submitted electronically using structured product labeling
(SPL)[8] format. Future updates to industry submissions are intended to be efficient to submit
because information from a previous submission can be applied without re-entering all
information. Technical assistance will be available for users by contacting a help desk for
Cosmetics Direct.

As an alternative, users may transmit SPL-formatted submissions through FDA’s Electronic
Submissions Gateway (ESG),[9] or any SPL authoring software including Xforms.[10] The FDA
ESG system requires users to apply for a free account before submitting data, a process which
can take one to three weeks. FDA therefore urges those who are planning to use the ESG to

apply for ESG accounts well in advance of the deadline for data submission. Technical
[assistance is available for users by contacting the ESG at ESGHelpDesk@fda.hhs.gov](mailto:ESGHelpDesk@fda.hhs.gov)

FDA developed paper forms (FDA Form 5066 and 5067) as another alternative submission tool.
Both the Cosmetics Direct and the paper forms are accessible at
[https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/registration-listing-cosmetic-product-facilities-and-products.](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/registration-listing-cosmetic-product-facilities-and-products)

###### F. When must you register and list under section 607 of the FD&C Act?

**1. Registration**

a. Initial Registration

Every person that, on December 29, 2022, owns or operates a facility that engages in the
manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United States
must register each facility no later than December 29, 2023 (section 607(a)(1)(A) of the
FD&C Act).

Every person that owns or operates a facility that first engages, after December 29, 2022,
in manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United States,
must register such facility within 60 days of first engaging in such activity or by February
27, 2024, whichever is later (section 607(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act).

Note: On November 8, 2023, FDA issued a guidance for industry titled “Compliance
Policy for Cosmetic Product Facility Registration and Cosmetic Product Listing.” This
guidance explains that FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements under section
607 of the FD&C Act related to cosmetic product facility registration until July 1, 2024.

b. Amended Registration

Every person who is required to register must update their registration within 60 days of
any changes to the information required for registration (section 607(a)(4) of the FD&C
Act) (an “amended” registration). This includes any changes that result in cancellation of
the registration.

c. Renewal of Registration

Every person who is required to register a facility must renew such registration biennially
(i.e., every two years) (section 607(a)(2) of the FD&C Act).

FDA is providing for an abbreviated renewal of registrations when there have not been
any updates to the registration since the most recent facility registration submission, as
required under section 607(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.

Note: In the case of a contract manufacturer, a facility registration may be submitted by the
contract manufacturer or any responsible person whose products are manufactured or processed
at such facility (section 607(a)(3) of the FD&C Act). Also, note that the renewal period and
timeframe to submit updates for a cosmetics product facility registration may be different than
for other FDA-regulated products for which the facility may also be required to register.


-----

## Page 152

**2. Product Listing**

a. Initial Listing

The responsible person of a cosmetic product that is marketed on December 29, 2022,
must submit a cosmetic product listing, or ensure such submission is made, not later than
December 29, 2023, or for a cosmetic product that is first marketed after December 29,
2022, within 120 days of marketing such product in interstate commerce (section
607(c)(2) of the FD&C Act). Consistent with the approach for registration of a facility
that starts manufacturing or processing cosmetic products after December 29, 2022
(section 607(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act), FDA expects the product listing for a cosmetic
product first marketed after December 29, 2022, to be submitted within 120 days of
marketing the product, or within 120 days of December 29, 2023 (which is April 27,
2024), whichever is later.

Note: On November 8, 2023, FDA issued a guidance for industry titled “Compliance
Policy for Cosmetic Product Facility Registration and Cosmetic Product Listing.” This
guidance explains that FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements under section
607 of the FD&C Act related to cosmetic product listing until July 1, 2024.

b. Update to Content and Renewal

The responsible person must provide any updates to such listing annually (section
607(c)(5) of the FD&C Act). This includes an update that the product was discontinued.

FDA is providing for an abbreviated process for the renewal of any cosmetic product
listing, as required under section 607(c)(3), for which there has been no change since the
responsible person submitted the previous listing.

###### G. What if my product is both a drug and a cosmetic product? Do have I have to comply with cosmetic product facility registration and cosmetic product listing requirements under section 607 of the FD&C Act? 

A cosmetic product that is also a drug is not subject to the listing requirements under section 607
of the FD&C Act. Likewise, a facility that manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are
also drugs is not subject to the registration requirement under section 607 unless it also
manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are not also drugs (see section 613 of the
FD&C Act). Cosmetic product facility registration and product listing are available using the
same electronic submission process available to register an establishment and list a drug with
FDA. This will help to streamline the process of submitting registration and listing information
for cosmetics facilities and products for entities that also submit drug establishment and listing
information.

###### H. Does FDA charge a fee to submit a registration or product listing under section 607 of the FD&C Act?

No. There is no fee to submit a registration or product listing to FDA under section 607 of the
FD&C Act.

###### APPENDIX B[11]

**Frequently Asked Questions and Answers**

**Q1. Do owners and operators of facilities that only manufacture or process cosmetic**

**ingredients need to register their facilities? Does a responsible person need to submit a**
**product listing for cosmetic ingredients?**

A. No, at this time, FDA only expects non-exempt facilities to register if they manufacture or

process the final formulation of cosmetic ingredients (including a final formulation that
includes a single ingredient). This includes final formulations that have not yet been
packaged. FDA only expects non-exempt responsible persons to list cosmetic products that
are marketed for users (e.g., consumers or professional use).

**Q2. Can a consultant be a “responsible person” under section 607 of the FD&C Act?**

A. A consultant can only be a responsible person if they meet the definition of “responsible

person” in section 604(4) of the FD&C Act. A “responsible person” as defined in section
604(4) of the FD&C Act, means the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a cosmetic
product whose name appears on the label of such cosmetic product in accordance with
section 609(a) of the FD&C Act or section 4(a) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.

**Q3. Can a company located outside of the U.S. be the “responsible person”?**

A. “Responsible person,” as defined in section 604(4) of the FD&C Act, means the

manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a cosmetic product whose name appears on the label
of such cosmetic product in accordance with section 609(a) of the FD&C Act or section 4(a)
of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. A company located outside of the U.S. could be a
“responsible person” so long as they are the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the
cosmetic product. However, we note that, under section 609(a) of the FD&C Act, each
cosmetic product shall bear a label that includes a domestic address, domestic phone number,
or electronic contact information, which may be a website, through which the responsible
person can receive adverse event reports with respect to such cosmetic product. We
recommend that firms consider when selecting electronic contact information, such as an
email address or a website (whether foreign or domestic), how they can best respond to these
reports and meet maintenance, inspection, and reporting requirements under section 605 of
the FD&C Act.


**Q4. Is the brand name the same as the product name?**


A. No. FDA does not consider the brand name and product name to be the same.


11 This section of the guidance, Appendix B (designated with a shaded background), is being distributed for
comment purposes only.


-----

## Page 159

The product name is generally considered the statement of identity, as required under 21 CFR
701.11. The statement of identity provides information about the type or kind of cosmetic
product in the package to help the consumer understand the functional use of the product.

The brand name is the distinguishing name used by a company to identify a commercial product
on the product label. The brand name may be proprietary and/or registered as a trademark.

**Q5. What are examples of products whose manufacture does not qualify the responsible**

**person or facility for the small business exemptions under section 612 of the FD&C**
**Act?**

A. Section 612 of the FD&C Act provides exemptions to certain small businesses from the

requirements of sections 606 (Good Manufacturing Practice) and 607 (Registration and
Product Listing). However, such exemptions from the requirements of sections 606 and 607
of the FD&C Act do not apply to any responsible person or facility engaged in the
manufacturing or processing of any of the following products listed in section 612(b) of the
FD&C Act:

_(1) Cosmetic products that regularly come into contact with mucus membrane of the eye under_
_conditions of use that are customary or usual._

_(2) Cosmetic products that are injected._

_(3) Cosmetic products that are intended for internal use._

_(4) Cosmetic products that are intended to alter appearance for more than 24 hours under_
_conditions of use that are customary or usual and removal by the consumer is not part of such_
_conditions of use that are customary or usual._

**Q6. What are examples of products that regularly come into contact with the mucus**
**membrane of the eye?**

A. While there may be certain exceptions, an eye makeup remover, a liquid or mucosal eyeliner,

or a false eyelash adhesive may regularly come into contact with the mucous membrane of
the eye under conditions of use that are customary or usual, such that they would not qualify
the small business exemption (see section 612(b)(1) of the FD&C Act). However, facial
cleaners, moisturizers, and serums generally would not be expected to regularly come into
contact with the mucous membrane of the eye under conditions of use that are customary or
usual.

**Q7. What are examples of products that are intended to alter appearance for more than 24**
**hours?**

A. Examples of cosmetic products that are intended to alter the appearance for more than 24

hours and removal by the consumer is not part of such conditions of use that are customary
or usual, as described in section 612(b)(4) of the FD&C Act, may include certain nail
polishes, some hair products, some eyebrow dyes, and certain leave-on skin preparations. To


-----

## Page 160

determine if a product falls under section 612(b)(4) of the FD&C Act one should consider
product labeling, including directions for use, as well as the uses of the product that are not
indicated in the labeling but are customary or usual.

**Q8. If a facility engages in the manufacturing or processing of cosmetic products listed in**
**section 612(b) of the FD&C Act, does the facility need to include information required**
**under section 607(b)(2)(D) and (E) for only the cosmetic products listed in section 612(b),**
**or for all of the cosmetic products manufactured or processed by the facility?**

A. The exemptions in section 612 of the FD&C Act apply to responsible persons and owners

and operators of facilities that meet the definition of a small business in section 612(a).
Thus, a facility is required to include information required under section 607(b)(2)(D) and
(E) for all of the cosmetic products manufactured or processed by the facility if a facility
manufactures or processes any of the following cosmetic products:

_(1) Cosmetic products that regularly come into contact with mucus membrane of the eye under_
_conditions of use that are customary or usual._

_(2) Cosmetic products that are injected._

_(3) Cosmetic products that are intended for internal use._

_(4) Cosmetic products that are intended to alter appearance for more than 24 hours under_
_conditions of use that are customary or usual and removal by the consumer is not part of such_
_conditions of use that are customary or usual._

**Q9. Where can I submit documentation that my business meets the small business**

**exemption in order to receive an exemption certificate from FDA?**

A. FDA is not generally asking companies to submit this information nor does FDA provide

small business exemption certificates for cosmetic product facilities or responsible persons.

**Q10. Does an importer need to register and/or list under 607 of the FD&C Act?**

A. If an importer meets the definition of a facility and/or a responsible person in section 604 of

the FD&C Act, and does not meet any exemption, then they must comply with any
applicable registration or listing requirements. Otherwise, the importer is not required to
register or list.

**Q11. Does a laboratory that only performs testing on cosmetic products used for research**
**and development need to register?**

A. No. If a laboratory tests cosmetic products that are solely for use in research, development, or

evaluation, and that are not offered for retail sale, it does not need to register because it is an


-----

## Page 161

establishment that is not included in the definition of facility in section III.B. above (see
section 604(3)(B)(vii) of the FD&C Act).

**Q12. Does a laboratory that performs cosmetic product batch release testing need to**
**register?**

A. Yes. Cosmetic product batch release testing is part of manufacturing and processing.

Laboratories conducting this testing are considered facilities subject to the registration
requirements.

**Q13. My company owns 2 buildings with 2 addresses, and 1 of the buildings is for storage**

**only. Do we need to register the building used only for storage?**

A. No. An establishment that solely performs storage (holding) with respect to cosmetic

products is not required to register under section 607 of the FD&C Act.

**Q14. If a contract manufacturer of cosmetic products is located outside of the United States**

**are they required to be registered with the FDA under section 607 of the FD&C Act? Is**
**there an exemption from registration if the contract manufacturer follows ISO22716?**

A. If a contract manufacturer manufactures or processes cosmetic product(s) distributed in the

United States, then the contract manufacturing facility must be registered with the FDA, even
if the contract manufacturer is located outside of the United States. More information,
including on exemptions, are described in section III above. There is not an exemption from
registration for following ISO22716.

**Q15. Do hair coloring preparations (including hair dyes) need to be listed?**

A. Yes. Hair coloring preparations, including hair dyes, are cosmetic products and therefore

need to be listed, unless an exemption applies.

**Q16. Do hairbrushes and wigs need to be listed?**

A. No. We do not expect hairbrushes and wigs to be listed.

**Q17. My cosmetic products don’t fit into any of the product categories provided in**

**Appendix A. Therefore, what product category and code should be used?**

A. We recommend that you select the product category and code in Appendix A (above) that

match most closely and use the “other” category and code if another category and code does
not appear to fit. Keep in mind that products intended for use in the eye area should be
entered into an eye area product category.

FDA intends to periodically update the product categories and codes. Any proposed update

to the product categories and codes FDA intends to publish as draft guidance on our website,
with a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the draft guidance document is


-----

## Page 162

available. After providing an opportunity for public comment on the draft guidance, FDA
will:

_(A)_ _Review any comments received and prepare the final version of the guidance document that_

_incorporates suggested changes, when appropriate;_

_(B)_ _Publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the guidance document is_

_available;_

_(C)_ _Post the guidance document on the Internet and make it available in hard copy; and_

_(D) Implement the guidance document._

**Q18. What is the receipt date for registrations and listings submitted via paper form?**

A. When FDA receives a paper submission, the submission is assigned a receipt date. The

receipt date for a paper submission is the date on which the submission is deemed to have
arrived at FDA. A paper submission is deemed to have arrived at FDA on the date on which
it arrived physically at the appropriate receiving unit, while open for business, for the FDA
unit that will review the submission. If paper registration and listing forms are mailed, we
recommend using a method that includes tracking.

FDA encourages electronic submission of registration and listing for cosmetic product

facilities and products.

**Q19. The cosmetic establishment registration is to be renewed biennially. Does this mean**

**the biennial renewal has to be done every two years from the date of initial**
**registration?**

A. Yes, a cosmetic product facility needs to renew its registration every two years from the date

of initial registration.

###### Compliance Policy for Cosmetic Product Facility Registration and Cosmetic Product Listing
 Guidance for Industry[1]

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA
or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office
responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

This guidance is intended to assist owners or operators of cosmetic product facilities that are
subject to the requirements related to facility registration and responsible persons that are subject
to the requirements related to cosmetic product listing under the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). This guidance document discusses FDA’s compliance policy for
these requirements. FDA intends to delay enforcement of these requirements for six months to
help ensure that industry has sufficient time to submit facility registration and product listing
information.

This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because the Agency has
determined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate. 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2).
This guidance is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in
accordance with the Agency’s good guidance practices. 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5).

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

**II.** **BACKGROUND**

On December 29, 2022, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Pub. L.
117-328) into law, which included the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022
(MoCRA). Among other provisions, MoCRA added section 607 to the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C.
364c), establishing requirements for cosmetic product facility registration and cosmetic product
listing.

1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) in cooperation with the Office of
Cosmetics and Colors (OCAC)/Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at the Food and Drug
Administration.

Section 607(a) of the FD&C Act requires every person that owns or operates a facility[2] that
“engages in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product for distribution in the United
States” to register each facility with FDA. Section 607(a)(1)(A) provides that owners or
operators of facilities engaged in the manufacturing or processing of a cosmetic product on
December 29, 2022, must register each facility no later than December 29, 2023. Owners or
operators of facilities that first engage in manufacturing or processing a cosmetic product after
December 29, 2022, must register such facilities within 60 days of first engaging in such activity
or by February 27, 2024, whichever is later (Section 607(a)(1)(B)).

Section 607(c) of the FD&C Act requires that for each cosmetic product, the responsible person[3]
must submit to FDA “a cosmetic product listing” or ensure that such submission is
made. Section 607(c)(2) of the FD&C Act provides that the responsible person for a cosmetic
product that was marketed on December 29, 2022, must submit a cosmetic product listing, no
later than December 29, 2023, or for a cosmetic product that is first marketed after December 29,
2022, within 120 days of distributing such product in interstate commerce.

Certain small businesses, as defined in section 612 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 364h), are not
required to register facilities and list cosmetic product(s). In addition, a facility is not required to
register if it is also subject to the requirements in chapter V of the FD&C Act (for drugs and
devices) unless the facility also manufactures or processes cosmetic products that are not subject
to the requirements of chapter V of the FD&C Act (see section 613 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C.
364i)). A cosmetic product does not need to be listed if it is also subject to the requirements in
chapter V of the FD&C Act (for drugs and devices).

FDA issued a draft guidance entitled “Registration and Listing of Cosmetic Product Facilities
and Products” on August 8, 2023 (88 FR 53490). The draft guidance, when finalized, will
provide recommendations and instructions to assist persons submitting cosmetic product facility
registrations and product listings to FDA.

FDA is also developing an electronic submission portal, Cosmetics Direct, to streamline
submission and receipt of facility registration and product listing information under section 607
of the FD&C Act, and is developing paper forms (FDA Form 5066 and 5067) as an alternative
submission tool. FDA will conduct a pilot program to ensure that the new electronic submission
portal is functional and usable so that industry will be able to meet its statutory obligations. As
another alternative, users may transmit SPL-formatted submissions through FDA’s Electronic
Submissions Gateway (ESG),[4] or any SPL authoring software including Xforms.[5] FDA strongly
encourages electronic submissions to facilitate efficiency and timeliness of data submission and
management for the agency. FDA anticipates that electronic submission, technical assistance
documents, and paper submission forms will be available in early December 2023.

2 The term “facility” is defined in section 604(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 364(3)).
3 The term “responsible person” is defined in section 604(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 364(4)).

**III.** **DISCUSSION**

FDA will be ready to accept registration and listing information by the statutory deadline of
December 29, 2023, and we encourage companies to meet that deadline if they are able to do so.
However, FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements under section 607 of the FD&C Act
related to cosmetic product facility registration and cosmetic product listing for an additional six
months after the December 29, 2023, statutory deadline, or until July 1, 2024, to provide
regulated industry additional time to comply with these requirements. In addition, FDA does not
intend to enforce the registration requirement for owners or operators of facilities that first
engaged in manufacturing or processing a cosmetic product after December 29, 2022, or the
listing requirement for cosmetic products first marketed after December 29, 2022, until July 1,
**2024.**

FDA intends to delay enforcement of the cosmetic product facility registration and product
listing requirements. Industry has expressed concerns that they need additional time, for
example to gather the relevant information required for facility registration and product listing,
including obtaining facility registration numbers to associate with cosmetic product listings,
obtain access to the electronic submissions database, and enter and submit accurate registration
and listing information.

77 **I. Introduction**

78 In response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, FDA adapted its operations for field
79 activities to provide oversight of regulated industry while mitigating the spread of COVID-19. One set of
80 tools used during the COVID-19 public health emergency for oversight of FDA-regulated products was
81 remote regulatory assessments (RRAs). The term “RRA” (as defined in the Question and Answers
82 section) is used to describe a category of activities for which FDA may use different terminologies, but
83 that are all considered to be types of RRAs, including “remote interactive evaluations”[2] and “remote
84 record reviews.” Such activities, along with others identified in this draft guidance, are considered RRAs
85 for purposes of this guidance. In the presence of travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA
86 utilized RRAs to assess establishments and their compliance with applicable FDA requirements. Based on

87 this experience,[3 ]FDA has noted the value of RRAs and concluded that they should be used for certain
88 scenarios outside the COVID-19 pandemic and for all types of FDA-regulated products.[4 ]FDA has
89 developed this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions related to RRAs. When
90 finalized, this guidance is intended to help enhance industry’s understanding of RRAs, thereby facilitating
91 FDA’s process for conducting RRAs.

92 Throughout this guidance, the terms, “FDA,” “the Agency,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Food and
93 Drug Administration. In this guidance, the term “establishment” includes any facility, entity, person,
94 importer, or site, whether foreign or domestic, subject to the laws administered by FDA.

95 FDA’s guidance documents, including this draft guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
96 responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe our current thinking on a topic and should be
97 viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use
98 of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not
99 required.

100 **II. Background**

101 FDA uses a variety of tools[5 ]for oversight of FDA-regulated products and establishments. During the
102 COVID-19 pandemic, FDA used RRAs to help the Agency conduct oversight, mitigate risk, and meet
103 critical public health needs with respect to certain FDA-regulated products. RRAs have included: (1)
104 mandatory RRAs involving review of records or other information submitted by certain establishments
105 upon request from FDA under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act and review of records from food
106 establishments subject to FD&C Act section 805[6 ](the latter hereinafter referred to as “requests for
107 Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) records under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) or 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C)”);
108 and (2) voluntary RRAs involving remote requests for records and/or interactive evaluations (such as
109 remote livestreaming video of operations, teleconferences, and screen sharing).

110 FDA’s experiences have identified significant benefits in using RRAs. For instance, RRAs have assisted
111 FDA in verifying corrective actions taken in response to inspections of previously compliant

3 See, e.g., FDA’s November 2021 “An Update to the Resiliency Roadmap for FDA Inspectional Oversight,” where
we reported on the use of RRAs as a tool to fortify FDA oversight efforts throughout the pandemic.
4 See, e.g., question A.2. describing to whom voluntary and mandatory RRAs may apply.
5 See, e.g., the discussion of alternative tools used for oversight listed in FDA’s May 2021 “Resiliency Roadmap for
FDA Inspectional Oversight,” and Section 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21
U.S.C. 374).
6 Section 805 of the FD&C Act requires importers as defined for purposes of section 805 of the FD&C Act to
perform certain risk-based Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) activities. Further, section 805(d) of the
FD&C Act provides for FSVP records to be made available promptly to the FDA upon request. The FSVP
regulation states that, if requested in writing by FDA, records must be sent to FDA electronically, or through any
other means that delivers the records promptly, rather than making them available for review at an importer’s place
of business. 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3), 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C).

112 manufacturers[7 ]and in gaining compliance insight when it was not practicable to inspect. RRAs have also
113 provided information about deficient practices, leading FDA to take regulatory actions and/or conduct
114 inspections, as well as informing future inspection planning. RRAs were used to help support review and
115 promote timely approval or authorization of marketing submissions for FDA-regulated products. In the
116 food program, RRAs have assisted in determining compliance with veterinary feed directive regulations,
117 assessing foreign manufacturing process records, adding foreign establishments to import alerts, and
118 issuance of warning letters.

119 Based on these experiences, FDA has determined that RRAs are valuable and, therefore, under certain
120 circumstances, should be continued to assist FDA in its mission to protect public health, oversee regulated
121 industry, and ensure all types of regulated products comply with FDA requirements.

122 With respect to section 704(a)(4), this provision of the FD&C Act, including as recently amended by the
123 Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA),[8 ]gives FDA authority to request (and requires
124 establishments to provide) any records or other information that FDA may inspect under section 704 of
125 the FD&C Act, in advance of or in lieu of inspections of such establishments that engage in the
126 manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug or device,[9 ]or a site or
127 facility that is subject to inspection under section 704(a)(5)(C) (i.e., sites, entities, or facilities subject to
128 bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) inspections).

129 The Agency believes that FDA’s use of both mandatory and voluntary RRAs, as applicable, for all types
130 of FDA-regulated products is in the interest of the public health, and the Agency is issuing this guidance
131 to provide further transparency to stakeholders about the circumstances in which mandatory and
132 voluntary RRAs may be used.

133 The Agency is also issuing this guidance to promote greater consistency in the way RRAs are conducted,
134 including explaining processes for responding to an RRA request, and outlining factors we use for
135 evaluating whether an establishment has responded timely and appropriately to a mandatory request.

7 In instances where FDA has identified objectionable conditions regarding compliance with laws and regulations
enforced by FDA (e.g., Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements for FDA-regulated products), FDA may
subsequently determine compliance based on a voluntary commitment of corrective actions, or, when warranted,
FDA may pursue a regulatory action. If FDA pursues a regulatory action after conducting an RRA, we generally
will conduct an inspection to confirm that corrective actions have been implemented; however, for certain regulatory
actions and with respect to select instances involving certain programs, FDA could determine that an RRA is
appropriate.
8 FDORA was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (2022). FDORA
sections 3611(b)(1)(A) and 3612(a) added device and bioresearch monitoring establishments as establishments that
are subject to mandatory requests for records or other information under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act (21
U.S.C. 374(a)(4)).
9 The terms “drug” and “device” are defined at FD&C Act sections 201(g)(1) and (h), respectively. With respect to
drugs, a “drug” includes human and animal drugs (including all compounded human and animal drugs), and
biological drug products for humans.

136 **III. Questions and Answers**

137 This section is intended to provide FDA’s current thinking regarding the requesting, conducting, and use
138 of RRAs by FDA.

139 **A. Remote Regulatory Assessment Fundamentals**

140 _1. What is an RRA?_

141 An RRA is an examination of an FDA-regulated establishment and/or its records, conducted entirely
142 remotely, to evaluate compliance with applicable FDA requirements. RRAs assist in protecting human
143 and animal health, informing regulatory decisions, and verifying certain information submitted to the
144 Agency.

145 RRAs are a tool FDA may use to support regulatory decisions and oversight activities. Mandatory RRAs
146 are conducted under legal authorities mandating the establishment’s participation. Requests for records or
147 other information from establishments subject to section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, and requests for
148 FSVP records under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), are included among RRAS that are
149 mandatory. RRAs that are not conducted under statutory or regulatory authorities mandating an
150 establishment’s participation are voluntary in that an establishment can decline to participate or withdraw
151 participation during the RRA, in which case the Agency may consider other tools for evaluating
152 compliance with FDA requirements.

153 RRAs complement FDA’s authority to conduct inspections under section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and
154 other applicable FDA authorities. RRAs do not limit the authority of FDA to conduct inspections under
155 section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and other applicable FDA authorities.

156 _2. Who may be subject to an RRA?_

157 - _Mandatory RRAs_

158 Mandatory RRAs include those conducted for: (1) establishments that are subject to section 704(a)(4) of
159 the FD&C Act10; and (2) importers, as defined in 21 CFR 1.500, that are subject to FSVP under section
160 805(d) of the FD&C Act and implementing regulations in 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) or 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), as
161 applicable.[11 ]

10 As described above, section 704(a)(4)’s mandatory records request authority applies to drug and device
establishments and to sites, entities, or facilities subject to BIMO inspections. See footnote 8 for information on
recent amendments that made device establishments and BIMO sites, entities, and facilities subject to mandatory
records request authority under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.
11 As discussed above, RRAs have included these mandatory remote requests for records or other information.
Although they are discussed in this draft guidance in response to certain frequently asked questions, RRAs
conducted under section 704(a)(4) or under FSVP are not necessarily the only types of mandatory RRAs for which
FDA has authority.

162 Upon initiating a mandatory RRA, FDA intends to make clear the authorities under which the RRA is
163 being requested.

164 - _Voluntary RRAs_

165 If an RRA is not mandated by statute or regulation (or FDA opts against exercising its mandatory RRA
166 authority in a certain instance), FDA may request that any establishment (e.g., food producers, tobacco
167 product manufacturers, drug or medical device manufacturers[12,13], clinical investigators, or others)
168 participate in a voluntary RRA.

169 _3. Are RRAs replacing other established means of obtaining information outside of_
170 _inspections?_

171 No, RRAs are not intended to limit or replace other established means of obtaining information necessary
172 for FDA to accomplish its public health mission outside of inspections, including, among other things,
173 applicant information request letters, registration confirmations, meetings, product submission,
174 application assessments, or follow-up communications during outbreaks or other emergencies. Similarly,
175 if, for example, FDA calls an applicant to inform them that a submission or application is missing certain
176 information, this is not an RRA. Although these activities may be conducted remotely, the Agency does
177 not consider these RRAs.[14 ]

178 _4. Is an RRA an inspection?_

179 An RRA is not an inspection under sections 704(a)(1) or 704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act. Generally, an
180 inspection, such as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, involves duly designated officers or
181 employees of the FDA physically entering (at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner),
182 establishments subject to regulation under the FD&C Act to determine compliance with applicable
183 requirements.[15 ]

184 However, because remote requests for FSVP records are under the authority of section 805(d) of the
185 FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulation, these record requests function as inspections in that FDA
186 uses these records requests to evaluate a food importer’s compliance with FSVP.

12 In this draft guidance, references to drug and device manufacturers means establishments that engage in the
manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug or device, respectively. See, e.g.,
section 510 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 207.1 and 807.3.
13 By virtue of applying to both drug and device establishments, section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act also applies to
establishments that manufacture, prepare, propagate, compound, or process combination products (see section
503(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act) and the drug and device constituent part(s) (defined under 21 CFR Part 4) of such
combination products. Establishments that engage in the manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or
processing of combination products that are not subject to the authorities under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act
may voluntarily participate in an RRA.
14 FDA intends to clearly indicate when we consider an activity to be an RRA so establishments can differentiate
RRA interactions from non-RRA interactions.
15 FD&C Act, section 704(a)(1). Relatedly, for requests for records and other information under section 704(a)(4),
FDA does not intend to issue a Form FDA 482, Notice of Inspection or Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations
during the RRA process.

187 _5. When may FDA initiate or request to conduct an RRA?_

188 FDA may initiate or, in the case of a voluntary RRA, request to conduct, an RRA whenever we determine
189 an RRA is appropriate to help fulfill the Agency’s regulatory responsibilities and protect human and

190 animal health. For example:

191 - When FDA cannot conduct an inspection due to travel limitations brought on by public health
192 emergencies, natural disasters, or other situations making travel infeasible.

193 - When FDA determines that an RRA will assist us in conducting elements of establishment
194 oversight or support regulatory decisions. Examples include preparing for an already planned

195 inspection, following up on a consumer complaint, assisting in verifying that an

196 establishment has completed certain corrective actions (e.g., in response to a previous
197 inspection, or previous RRA), or supporting the review of a marketing submission.

198 FDA intends to use a risk-based approach to determine whether to initiate or request an RRA. Factors that
199 may be considered include, but are not limited to, establishment location, inspection history, complexity

200 of product and process, and travel restrictions. Programs and centers within FDA may assess risk

201 differently based on those factors.


202 The above examples are illustrative, and the ultimate decision to initiate or request an RRA rests with
203 FDA, as we retain discretion to deploy RRAs as appropriate. FDA does not accept requests to perform an
204 RRA. When FDA determines an inspection (as opposed to an RRA) is necessary, FDA intends to perform

205 an inspection.

206 _6. Will FDA use RRAs during or as part of an FDA inspection of an establishment?_

207 No, FDA does not plan to conduct RRAs and inspections[16 ]of an establishment under sections 704(a)(1)
208 or 704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act simultaneously. An RRA is conducted remotely by FDA staff without
209 FDA staff present at an establishment conducting an inspection. However, an RRA could precede,

210 prompt, or be a follow-up to, an inspection. When an RRA precedes an inspection, FDA will generally

211 conclude the RRA prior to initiating the inspection. FDA may combine any information gained from the
212 RRA with any resulting observations from the subsequent inspection. In such circumstance, FDA would
213 confirm any observations from the RRA during the subsequent inspection before including them on any
214 Form FDA 483 Inspectional Observations issued at the conclusion of the subsequent inspection.


215 Additionally, FDA may conduct an RRA following an inspection in order to conduct follow-up activities

216 with the establishment or to assist in verifying corrective actions, if appropriate.

217 FDA may decide to conduct an RRA (e.g., livestreaming) during oversight activities independently
218 conducted by state or foreign regulatory partners.[17 ]

16 FDA considers inspections that are done with state officers or employees duly commissioned under 702(a)(1)(A)
of the FD&C Act to be FDA inspections for the purposes of this draft guidance.
17 Generally, FDA does not intend to conduct RRAs during Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) audits.

219 _7. What are the benefits of an RRA?_

220 FDA, industry, and the general public can all benefit from RRAs as RRAs help the Agency to meet
221 critical public health needs. These potential benefits may include, but are not limited to:

222 - Allowing FDA to remotely evaluate compliance of FDA-regulated products, clinical studies,
223 and establishments, as appropriate. This may identify issues that lead establishments to
224 promptly make corrective actions, which may enhance the establishment’s preparedness for
225 their next FDA inspection.

226 - Having an RRA precede an inspection under section 704(a) of the FD&C Act could reduce
227 resource expenditure. For example, FDA may not need to review as many records during the
228 inspection, reducing the time FDA is present at the establishment.

229 - Helping to support timely regulatory decisions (including the approval of an application or
230 authorization for emergency use), without an inspection, when appropriate conditions are
231 fulfilled, such as the ability to verify information in the marketing submission. In such cases,
232 the application approval, or the authorization, must still meet applicable standards.

233 - Providing FDA additional information to incorporate into a risk-based inspection schedule,
234 thereby helping FDA use inspectional resources more efficiently and effectively.

235 - Assisting FDA in verifying corrective actions.[18 ]

236 **B. Remote Regulatory Assessment Expectations**

237 _8. How may FDA request an RRA?_

238 FDA may use multiple processes for requesting voluntary or initiating mandatory RRAs.[19 ]

239 - _In general, for Voluntary RRAs_

240 `o` FDA expects to contact an establishment through the establishment’s point of
241 contact,[20] by email or phone, once we determine an RRA is appropriate based on
242 FDA mission needs.

18 See footnotes 2 and 7.
19 When finalized, this draft guidance will represent the Agency’s current thinking on how RRAs apply generally to
all FDA-regulated products. Other Agency documents may exist that provide additional information about RRAs
with respect to specific circumstances. See, e.g., FDA Staff Manual Guide 9004.1, Policy and Procedures for
Requesting Records in Advance of or in Lieu of a Drug Inspection; FDA Compliance Program Guidance Manual
7303.878, FSVP Inspections; Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring
Facilities, Draft Guidance for Industry, October 2023.
20 FDA will typically request to speak with an establishment’s owner, operator, or agent in charge at the site (i.e., top
management official at the site), or their designee.

9


-----

## Page 178

_Draft — Not for Implementation_

243 `o` FDA may use the establishment’s registration, establishment information provided in
244 a marketing submission, or additional information available to FDA, to identify the
245 point of contact, authorized official, or U.S. agent.

246 `o` FDA will obtain the establishment’s consent to the RRA before we begin the RRA.
247 Where practicable, FDA generally intends to seek to obtain such consent in writing.
248 This typically includes:

249 - notifying the establishment’s point of contact of the purpose and planned
250 scope of the RRA and of the right to refuse consent; and

251 - requesting that such person confirm the establishment voluntarily consents
252 and has the ability to participate in the voluntary RRA requested.

253 `o` If the establishment consents to the voluntary RRA, FDA will typically provide an
254 opportunity to discuss, as applicable and appropriate:

255 - FDA’s expectations for, and any establishment limitations in participating in,
256 the RRA.

257 - The scheduling of virtual interviews and meetings.

258 - Technological capabilities.[21 ]

259 - The process and timeline for requesting records or other information for
260 review.

261 - How and when FDA will provide feedback to the establishment.

262 - Any questions relating to the process or other aspects of the RRA.

263 - _In general, for Mandatory RRAs_

264 `o` FDA will initiate the request in accordance with the relevant legal authority and
265 intends to follow any established procedures.

266 - For example, for purposes of section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, FDA will
267 use Form FDA 4003 (for drug establishments) or a similar method for other
268 establishments subject to section 704(a)(4) to request records or other
269 information.[22 ]When making a section 704(a)(4) request, FDA will, under
270 this statutory authority, provide a sufficient description of the records or
271 other information requested, as well as our rationale for requesting such
272 records or other information in advance of, or in lieu of, an inspection.[23 ]

21 Any technical requirements, as applicable, will be discussed between FDA and the establishment prior to or
during an opening meeting. In conducting the RRA, FDA will determine best logistical approaches and/or
technology methods, as applicable, in coordination with the establishment.
22 The point of contact listed in the registration may be used as the point of contact. For pre-approval and pre­
licensing inspections, there may be situations when records are requested of an establishment under section
704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act related to products named in multiple applications. In these situations, FDA intends to
issue one Form FDA 4003 to the establishment to cover requests for records or other information for all of the
products in the applications being assessed.
23 See section 704(a)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act, as amended by FDORA.

_Draft — Not for Implementation_

273 Upon receipt of the requested records, we will provide confirmation of
274 receipt to the establishment.[24 ]

275 - Under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C) for imported foods, FDA
276 uses Form FDA 482d to request FSVP records.

277 Regardless of whether an RRA is mandatory or voluntary, FDA does not intend to issue a Form FDA
278 482, Notice of Inspection as part of the RRA process.[25 ]

279 _9. What might an establishment expect to happen during an RRA?_

280 RRAs may entail, but are not limited to, any combination of the following, depending on the type of RRA
281 involved:

282 - FDA requests and reviews records and other information (such as electronic systems, and
283 source records from non-clinical and clinical studies).

284 - Virtual meetings between FDA and responsible establishment personnel to review, where
285 appropriate, the information provided to FDA, the establishment’s electronic systems, the
286 establishment’s operations, and/or the establishment’s standard operating procedures.
287 Interactions beyond the virtual meeting between FDA and an establishment may continue
288 during the course of an RRA.

289 - Use of livestream and/or pre-recorded video, where appropriate, to examine facilities,
290 operations, data, and other information.

291 FDA may review electronic systems and source records by screen sharing and livestream/video.[26 ]FDA
292 may provide updates to the establishment on observations and outstanding issues, whenever feasible,
293 throughout the RRA. FDA expects to make reasonable and appropriate efforts to discuss observations
294 with the management of the establishment, to minimize surprises, errors, and misunderstandings.

295 While mandatory RRAs that are conducted under their respective relevant authorities involve activities
296 detailed by such authorities, an establishment could agree to participate in activities beyond what is
297 required. For instance, FDA may request that an establishment subject to a section 704(a)(4) records
298 request instead voluntarily participate in an RRA that accommodates review through interactive
299 technologies such as video streaming.

24 See section 704(a)(4)(B).
25 See footnote 15.
26 FDA does not intend to record RRAs conducted via livestream, video, or screen sharing; however, FDA may
request records we review during those sessions.

_10. Are there any consequences for declining to participate in an RRA?_


301 - _Voluntary RRAs_

302 Because of the voluntary nature of these assessments, declining to participate in a voluntary RRA will not
303 result in any enforcement action by the Agency based on the declination.[27 ]FDA may consider other
304 activities necessary to exercise our oversight responsibilities regarding that establishment, such as an

305 inspection, based on considerations such as when the establishment was last inspected, our assessment of

306 risks, and other relevant factors. An establishment may decline to participate in a voluntary RRA, but an
307 establishment may not opt out of an FDA inspection.


308 Moreover, if an establishment declines FDA’s request to conduct a voluntary RRA, FDA may not be able
309 to assess the establishment’s activities until we exercise other oversight tools. Indeed, a voluntary RRA

310 may be the most expedient means for FDA to assess the establishment, especially when factors prevent

311 FDA from conducting a timely inspection. For example, in circumstances which temporarily limit FDA’s
312 ability to conduct an inspection, such as travel restrictions, it may take FDA longer to assess an
313 establishment or, for example, a marketing submission in which an establishment is referenced, absent an
314 RRA because we lack necessary information.


315



- _Mandatory RRAs_


316 FDA may deem the following actions, among others, as declining to participate in a mandatory RRA:
317 failing to respond, withdrawing participation, and refusing to provide records upon a lawful request.
318 There are consequences for declining mandatory RRAs. For example, an establishment that refuses a
319 request for records or other information under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act may be in violation of

320 the FD&C Act.[28 ]

321 Similarly, if an importer refuses FDA’s written request for FSVP records under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) or
322 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), the importer may be in violation of section 805 of the FD&C Act, and the food offered
323 for import by the importer may be subject to refusal under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act.[29 ]


324 FDA intends to take appropriate action against persons[30 ]and products that are in violation of the FD&C

325 Act.

326 _11. Are there any technological expectations for an RRA?_

327 The technological expectations will vary depending on the type of RRA and its scope. Certain RRAs
328 involve records requests, and the records may be submitted electronically or through other means. Other
329 RRAs may require additional technological capability. For example, if FDA expects that the RRA could

330 include the use of live streaming video, FDA may inquire about hardware or internet connectivity to

331 assess IT operability, security, and privacy controls to protect the confidentiality of the data. The quality

27 This would not be considered a refusal for purposes of section 301(e) or (f), or 807, of the FD&C Act.
28 See e.g., section 301(e) of the FD&C Act (Prohibited Acts).
29 21 CFR 1.514(a).
30 See section 201(e) of the FD&C Act (Definitions).

332 of the remote connection (e.g., connectivity, image quality, cameras used) should be adequate for FDA to
333 review, observe, examine, and evaluate the requested records, documents, and other information
334 (including electronic systems). To the extent practicable, technologies employed should also allow access

335 for remotely viewing and evaluating operations at the establishment, as appropriate (e.g., aseptic

336 practices, equipment cleaning and set up, material weighing and dispensing, instrument set up, sampling,
337 and testing).


338 If an establishment is unable to support streaming video or other live virtual interactions, or if FDA
339 determines that the streaming video or any other virtual interaction during the RRA does not permit a

340 sufficient examination of the establishment or of a corrective action, FDA may use other available tools

341 or may terminate the RRA and consider other actions necessary to exercise our oversight responsibilities
342 regarding that establishment, such as an inspection.

343 Recommendations for sending records or other information are further explained in question 15, below.

344 **C. Requests for Records or Other Information as Part of Remote Regulatory Assessments**


345


_12. What records or other information may FDA request as part of an RRA?_


346 For voluntary RRAs, FDA may request records or other information appropriate to determine whether an
347 establishment or FDA-regulated product or clinical study is in compliance with applicable requirements.
348 The records and other information will typically be similar to what FDA would request during an
349 inspection under section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act.

350 In the case of mandatory RRAs, the records or other information we request, and the circumstances under

351 which we request them, will conform to the relevant legal authority. For example, under section
352 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, FDA may request any records or other information subject to inspection
353 under section 704. For mandatory RRAs under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), FDA may
354 request any and all records that are required to be maintained under 21 CFR 1, Subpart L.


355 Examples of records or other information the Agency may request during a voluntary or mandatory RRA

356 include, but are not limited to:

357 - Records of specific production lots or batches as well as product-specific information, such as
358 periodic product reviews,[31 ]product quality reports, equipment records, process validation
359 records and reports, test results, records of product postmarket defects or other information

360 related to compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements.

361 - Certain summaries or lists of records, such as a summary of batches manufactured and their
362 disposition, or a summary of discrepancies and investigations related to manufacturing and
363 testing.

31 See 21 CFR 211.180(e).

13

_Draft — Not for Implementation_

364 - Read-only access to electronic databases[32 ]or a request that an establishment walk us through

365 information in their database or provide data queries or summary data generated by the

366 establishment from their databases.

367 - Standard Operating Procedures and records generated by the establishment to document
368 control of quality systems and/or to demonstrate compliance with the applicable FDA
369 requirements.


370 - For FSVP importers, records related to hazard analysis, the importer’s determination of

371 appropriate supplier verification activities, performance of supplier verification activities,
372 and/or corrective actions.

373 - For establishments subject to BIMO inspection, records or data related to the reporting or
374 conduct of FDA-regulated research.

375 Where applicable, FDA intends to take appropriate efforts to minimize the quantity of records or other

376 information requested and may request that establishments take reasonable efforts to facilitate and
377 expedite FDA’s collection and review of records. See questions 14 and 15 for additional details.

378 _13. For what purposes may FDA use the records and other information gathered during an_
379 _RRA?_


380 Depending on the scope of the RRA, the information and documentation may be used by FDA for, among

381 other things,[33 ]the following regulatory purposes:

382 - Support FDA’s assessment of pending marketing submissions, including whether to approve
383 an application or whether to issue a response, such as a complete response letter.[34 ]

384 - Determine whether an establishment or product is or is not in compliance with certain FD&C

385 Act or PHS Act requirements, and other applicable requirements.

386 - Facilitate assessment of the need for an inspection in follow-up to a reported concern or
387 defect.

388 - Support actions such as a regulatory meeting, warning letter, import action, recall activity, or
389 other advisory action, or to support an administrative or judicial action.


390



    - Determine the priority of establishments for inspection, particularly a surveillance inspection.

32 See FDA Investigations Operations Manual (IOM) 5.10.2.1.
33 See, e.g., section 704(a)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act, as added by FDORA.
34 A complete response letter is either “a written communication to an applicant from FDA usually describing all of
the deficiencies that the Agency has identified in a new drug application or abbreviated new drug application that
must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved” (21 CFR 314.3); or “a written communication to an
applicant from FDA usually describing all of the deficiencies that the agency has identified in a biologics license
application or supplement that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved” (21 CFR 600.3(ll)); see
also 21 CFR 314.110 and 21 CFR 601.3.

391 _14. If the RRA requests records or other information, what is the timeframe for submitting_
392 _the records and other information to FDA?_

393 For mandatory RRAs, FDA will request that records and other information be submitted within a
394 timeframe consistent with the relevant legal authority.[35] For voluntary RRAs, FDA may suggest
395 timeframes to ensure the RRA is completed in a reasonable amount of time and expects establishments to
396 work diligently to provide the requested records and other information.
397 The circumstances that relate to FDA’s expectations for reasonable request timeframes may include:

398 - The size, available resources, and capabilities of the establishment, including those that might
399 exist for small businesses.

400 - The type, complexity, and volume of the records and other information being requested.

401 - The reason for the request, such as an application action goal date, deadline, or other time­
402 sensitive reasons.

403 - Need for translation of records.

404 _15. How should records or other information in response to an RRA request be provided to_
405 _FDA?_

406 Except as provided below, requested records or other information generally should be submitted in an
407 electronic format. FDA intends to provide a secure means to send requested records and information. For
408 electronic documents, establishments should identify any limitations on external access and ensure that
409 encrypted and password-protected files can be accessed by FDA. FDA will follow applicable federal law
410 governing the confidentiality of records and information submitted to the Agency (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C.
411 552(b)(4), 18 U.S.C. 1905, 21 C.F.R. Part 20).

412 FDA recognizes that some establishments maintain documents in paper format. Requested documents
413 maintained in paper format should be scanned as searchable Portable Document Format (PDF) files, when
414 possible, and sent by the secure means identified by FDA. If a paper format is the only option for sending
415 copies of records, FDA will provide the name and contact information of the FDA staff member to whom
416 the records should be sent.

35 For example, for RRAs under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, persons subject to the request must provide the
requested records or other information within a reasonable timeframe, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable
manner. See Section 704(a)(4)(A). See also FDA’s Staff Manual Guide, 9004.1, Policy and Procedures for
Requesting Records in Advance of or in lieu of a Drug Inspection for more information on timeframes. For RRAs
under section 805(d) of the FD&C Act, persons subject to the request must provide the records promptly. FDA
generally expects FSVP records to be sent within 72 hours of the request. See FDA’s Guidance for Industry: Foreign
Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals, available here:

417 FDA may request that records and other information be in English or accompanied by an English
418 translation.[36 ]If translated, the translation should be complete and accurate, and, when applicable, should
419 include the name, address, and a brief statement of the qualifications of the translator. Copies of the

420 original records and information should also be included in the response, where appropriate. For certain

421 RRAs, if a verified translation is not immediately available, FDA may request that the initial translation
422 be followed up with a verified translation as soon as practicable.


423 If the records or other information are provided as part of a section 704(a)(4) request, the records and
424 information may be submitted in either electronic or physical form. FDA will provide confirmation upon

425 receipt of the records. [37] In general, FDA intends to maintain open communications to discuss any records

426 received over the course of the RRA.

427 For RRAs under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C), records must be sent electronically, or
428 through any other means that delivers the records promptly upon written request from FDA.

429 **D. Completion of a Remote Regulatory Assessment**


430


_16. What may occur upon completion of an RRA?_


431 Upon completion of an RRA, FDA may have a closeout meeting[38 ]with the establishment’s management.
432 At the closeout meeting, FDA may present a written list of RRA observations, if any, and describe and
433 discuss such observations in sufficient detail to enable understanding and foster an appropriate response.
434 For purposes of this guidance, RRA observations are defined as conditions and/or practices observed

435 during the RRA that indicate, in the judgment of the FDA employee(s) conducting the RRA, a potential

436 violation of the laws enforced by FDA. FDA does not intend to issue a Form FDA 483, Inspectional
437 Observations, for an RRA.[39 ](See question 6 for a discussion of how observations from an RRA may be
438 confirmed during an inspection and included on a Form 483).

439 An establishment should be aware that a written list of observations may be subject to a request under the

440 Freedom of Information Act at the time the disclosure to the establishment is first made (see 21 CFR

441 20.101(a)) and may be made publicly available, with applicable redaction of information that is exempt
442 from public disclosure (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b), 18 U.S.C. 1905, 21 U.S.C. 331(j), 360j(c), 360nn(e),
443 and 387f(c), and 21 C.F.R. Part 20).


444 FDA encourages establishments to respond during the meeting, and/or provide written responses to the

445 observations within fifteen (15) U.S. business days. Responses or corrective actions submitted to FDA

446 during that timeframe in response to the issues identified during the RRA generally will be considered

36 For RRAs of FSVP importers, upon FDA request, the importers must provide within a reasonable time an English
translation of records maintained in a language other than English. See 21 CFR 1.510(b)(1), 1.512(b)(5)(C)(ii)(A).
37 Section 704(a)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act.
38 There may be some instances where a closeout meeting may not happen, such as for some requests under section
704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. In such circumstances, FDA intends to notify the establishment that the RRA is
concluded, along with any pertinent information.
39 FDA will use a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations, to issue observations to an importer based on RRAs that are
FSVP record reviews under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C).

447 before further Agency action or decision. Establishment responses are available for public disclosure as
448 described in 21 CFR 20.103 with redaction of non-public information, as appropriate.

449 FDA’s written list of RRA observations is not a final Agency action or decision. However, evidence
450 collected in the course of an RRA may be used in support of such actions or decisions.

451 Following an RRA, FDA may conduct an inspection. FDA may consider other actions, as appropriate,
452 including an enforcement action.

453 As part of the RRA process, FDA intends to ordinarily prepare a report consisting of a narrative and
454 supporting documents that communicates the summary of information reviewed, conditions and practices
455 found, and the observations identified. FDA generally expects to provide a written copy of the narrative
456 portion of the RRA report[40 ]to the establishment, following the determination that the RRA is closed (see
457 21 CFR 20.64(d)(3)). At that time, the report and supporting documents, with any applicable redactions,
458 also become available for public disclosure upon request.

40 There may be some instances where a report may not be written or provided, such as when the requested records
under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act were used to prepare for an inspection or for some requests for FSVP
records under 21 CFR 1.510(b)(3) and 1.512(b)(5)(ii)(C).

##### Insanitary Conditions in the Preparation, Packing, and Holding of Tattoo Inks and the Risk of Microbial Contamination: 
 Guidance for Industry[1]

This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA or we) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is
not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach,
contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

###### I. Introduction

Under section 601(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C.
361(c)), a cosmetic is deemed to be adulterated if it “has been prepared, packed, or held under
insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may
have been rendered injurious to health.” Cosmetic products prepared, packed, or held under
insanitary conditions could become contaminated and cause serious adverse events. The risk of
such adverse events is even greater in products such as tattoo inks, which are introduced through
the skin.

Tattooing has become increasingly popular in the United States. Polling and data suggest that
about 30 percent of all Americans, and 40 percent of those aged 18-34, have at least one tattoo
(Refs. 1 and 2). State and local jurisdictions generally regulate the practice of intradermal
tattooing, including permanent makeup. FDA regulates, among other things, the inks used in
that practice.[2] Tattoo inks are cosmetics as defined by section 201(i) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(i)) because they are articles intended to be
introduced into or otherwise applied to the human body for beautifying, promoting
attractiveness, or altering the appearance.

FDA is issuing this guidance to help tattoo ink manufacturers and distributors recognize
situations in which a tattoo ink may become contaminated with microorganisms, and thus, be
potentially injurious to health. This guidance also recommends certain steps that manufacturers
and distributors could take to help prevent the occurrence of these conditions, or to identify and
remediate insanitary conditions that already exist during manufacturing and distribution.

1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Cosmetics and Colors and the Office of Regulations and Policy
in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
2 Pigments, which are color additives regulated by FDA, are a component of finished tattoo inks. This guidance
focuses on microbial contamination of finished inks.

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

###### II. Background

Human skin is composed of multiple layers, including the epidermis, or outermost skin layer that
serves as the body’s primary physical barrier against pathogens and other harms; and the dermis,
or deeper layer that contains, among other things, blood and lymphatic vessels. Microorganisms
are normally present on the epidermis, but not in deeper skin layers, such as the dermis.
Microorganisms normally regarded as nonpathogenic when applied topically may become
opportunistically pathogenic and virulent when introduced in other ways (e.g., in wounds or via
cosmetics introduced into or through the skin).[3] The presence of microorganisms in deeper skin
layers may give rise to infection and inflammation.

Tattooing involves puncturing the epidermis about 100 times per second with needles and
depositing ink 1.5 to 2 millimeters below the surface of the skin, deep into the dermis (Ref. 3). It
generally causes bleeding because the needles pierce the blood vessels (Refs. 4 and 5).
Contaminated tattoo ink can cause infections and serious injuries. Because these inks are
injected, pathogens or other harmful substances in these inks can travel from the injection site
through the blood and lymphatic systems to other parts of the body. Commonly reported
symptoms of tattoo ink-associated infections include injection-site rashes and other lesions,
including blisters and granulomas, some of which have resulted in permanent scarring. Tattooassociated microbiological infections can also include impetigo,[4] erysipelas,[5] cellulitis,[6] and
systemic infections that can cause life-threatening complications such as endocarditis, septic
shock, and multi-organ failure (Ref. 8). Indications of an infection can be difficult to recognize,
as other conditions (e.g., allergic reactions or other sources of inflammation) may initially have
similar signs and symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatments.

We have received multiple reports of illness caused by microbially contaminated tattoo inks, and
subsequent testing has found many sealed tattoo inks in the United States with microbial
contamination. For instance, in 2012, contaminated tattoo inks caused a multi-state outbreak of
nontuberculous mycobacterial skin infections (Ref. 9). Nontuberculous mycobacterial skin
infections can produce a range of symptoms, from mild inflammation (e.g., rash, papules,

3 See Subpart J, “Microbiological Findings,” in Bacteriological Analytical Manual, Chapter 23: Methods for
Cosmetics, available at https://www.fda.gov/food/laboratory-methods-food/bam-chapter-23-methods-cosmetics
(accessed January 5, 2022).
4 Impetigo is a contagious superficial pus-forming bacterial infection which begins with a superficial blister that
ruptures and forms a yellowish crust (Ref. 6).
5 Erysipelas is a specific, acute, superficial infection of the skin caused by bacterium and characterized by hot, red,
swollen, thickened, and sharply defined eruptions (Ref. 6).
6 Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that causes redness, swelling, and pain in the infected area of the
skin. If untreated, it can spread and cause serious health problems (Ref. 7).

nodules) to severe abscesses requiring extensive and multiple surgical debridements[7] and
antimicrobial therapies. Between 2003 and 2019, tattoo ink firms conducted 15 voluntary ink
recalls, 14 of which resulted from findings of microbial contamination. Eight of these recalls
(Refs. 11-16) occurred after FDA conducted multiple surveys of tattoo inks available in the U.S.
market and tested them for microbial contamination. Many of these inks were heavily
contaminated with a variety of microorganisms, some of which (such as Pseudomonas
_aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus) can cause serious infections (Refs. 16 and 17). In 2018, an_
article in the Journal of Applied Microbiology reported that 49 percent of the surveyed tattoo
inks on the U.S. market were contaminated with microorganisms (Ref. 17). In 2019, we alerted
consumers, tattoo artists, and retailers of the potential for serious injury from use of certain tattoo
inks contaminated with bacteria, and we worked with manufacturers and retailers to remove the
products from the market (Ref. 16).[8]

Facilities where tattoo inks are prepared, packed, or held are responsible for ensuring that the
tattoo inks are not prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby the tattoo ink
may become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.
Tattoo inks prepared, packed, or held under such conditions are adulterated under the FD&C
Act. Therefore, upon identification, such insanitary conditions would need to be remediated.

###### III. Discussion

**A.** **General Considerations**

In evaluating whether tattoo inks are adulterated because they have been prepared, packed, or
held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been contaminated with filth, or
whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health, we generally consider the following
factors:

  - Tattoo inks are used by a wide variety of consumers. Therefore, when evaluating the
potential harms associated with tattoo inks, we consider use by any person, including
anyone who may be immunocompromised or have other relevant underlying medical
conditions.

  - Tattoo inks bypass the body’s primary physical barrier against pathogens, because they
are inserted below the epidermis.

  - Pathogens that may cause no harm in a topical product may cause harm when inserted
below the epidermis because of their type or amount.

7 Debridement is the removal, usually via surgery, of torn, dead, or contaminated tissue (Ref. 10).
8 Note that the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub.
L. No. 117-328, § 3502 (2022)) establishes new requirements for the reporting to FDA of serious adverse events
associated with the use of cosmetic products.

**B.** **Examples of Insanitary Conditions**

The following insanitary conditions during manufacturing and distribution could render a tattoo
ink injurious to health:

  - Preparing or packing of tattoo inks in facilities not suitable for such activities (e.g.,
spaces that are difficult to clean and sanitize, such as carpeted areas);

  - Ink, ink components (e.g., pigments, water, solvents), and primary packaging containers
held uncovered, especially near open air ducts, potentially exposing them to airborne
microbial contaminants and filth;

  - The presence of ink and ink components (e.g., pigments, water, other solvents)
contaminated with microorganisms;

  - Ink and ink components (e.g., pigments, water, other solvents) held in containers that
have not been cleaned and sanitized;

  - Insanitary mixing of tattoo inks, including:

`o` The use of containers and utensils that are not cleaned and sanitized; and
`o` The use of containers without covers that expose in-process inks to microbial
contaminants from the air;

  - Lack of appropriate attire by personnel during manufacturing, including the failure to use
hairnets, lab coats, aprons, gowns, masks, or gloves;

  - Failure to equip employee restrooms with soap and water, or the lack of signage directing
employees to wash their hands;

  - Disposal of used personal protection clothing (e.g., gloves, masks, gowns) in the
production area; and

  - Storage of packaged products in locations that render them susceptible to contamination
(e.g., around heavy buildup of dust and debris).

**C.** **Recommendations**

Manufacturers can take measures to help ensure that tattoo inks are not prepared, packed, or held
under insanitary conditions whereby they may be contaminated with microorganisms, including:

  - Test ink and ink components (e.g., pigments, water, other solvents) for microbial
contamination or purchase these materials from suppliers that test for microbial
contamination. Discard any materials that contain microorganisms of a type or at a level
that may harm any consumer if present in the finished product;

**_Draft-Not for Implementation_**

  - Ensure that the manufacturing process itself does not introduce microbial contamination
(e.g., by conducting adequate cleaning and sanitization of manufacturing equipment,
providing personal protective equipment to employees);

  - Ensure that any sterilization method used is validated. For example, if products are
intended to be “sterile,” perform appropriate validated sterilization of the finished
product;

  - Ensure that any cleaning or sterilization method used does not adulterate the finished
product (e.g., that irradiation causes no byproducts in the ink that could create poisonous
or deleterious substances in the ink which may render it injurious to users under expected
conditions of use); and

  - Take corrective measures to prevent the release of any final product that microbiological
testing shows contains microorganisms of a type or at a level that may harm any
consumer and reexamine manufacturing and validation procedures to determine the cause
of final product contamination.

We also suggest examining and, where appropriate, establishing good manufacturing practices
(GMPs) or applying GMPs that pertain to cosmetics generally (see, for example, International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard pertaining to cosmetics, ISO 22716, titled
“Cosmetics – Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) – Guidelines on Good Manufacturing
Practices” (Ref. 18)).[9] We note that we intend to conduct rulemaking to establish good
manufacturing practice regulations as part of the implementation of the Modernization of
Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022, which requires FDA to establish good manufacturing
practice regulations that, to the extent practicable and appropriate, are consistent with national
and international standards.[10]

###### Guidance for Industry Considering Whether an FDA-Regulated Product Involves the Application of Nanotechnology[1]

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s or the Agency’s) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the
telephone number listed on the title page of this guidance.

**I.** **INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE**

Nanotechnology is an emerging technology that can be used in a broad array of FDA-regulated
products, including medical products (e.g. to increase bioavailability of a drug), foods (e.g., to
improve food packaging) and cosmetics (e.g. to affect the look and feel of cosmetics). Materials
in the nanoscale range (i.e., with at least one dimension in the size range of approximately 1
nanometer (nm) to 100 nm) can exhibit different chemical or physical properties, or biological
effects compared to larger-scale counterparts. For example, dimension-dependent properties or
phenomena may be used for functional effects such as increased bioavailability, decreased
dosage, or increased potency of a drug product, decreased toxicity of a drug product, better
detection of pathogens, more protective food packaging materials, or improved delivery of a
functional ingredient or a nutrient in food (Refs. 1-6). These effects may derive from altered
chemical, biological, or magnetic properties, altered electrical or optical activity, increased
structural integrity, or other unique characteristics of materials in the nanoscale range not
normally observed or expected in larger-scale materials with the same chemical composition
(Ref. 7). Materials or end products may also exhibit similar properties or phenomena attributable
to a dimension(s) outside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm (Refs. 27-30; see
also discussion in Section II.B.5).

For the purpose of this guidance only, references to “products that involve the application of
nanotechnology” or “nanotechnology products” mean products that contain or are manufactured
using materials in the nanoscale range, as well as products that contain or are manufactured using
certain materials that otherwise exhibit related dimension-dependent properties or phenomena.
Likewise, we use the term “nanomaterial” generally to refer to both materials in the nanoscale

1 This guidance finalizes the draft guidance, entitled “Draft Guidance for Industry: Considering Whether an FDARegulated Product Involves the Application of Nanotechnology,” which was issued in June, 2011. This guidance
was prepared by FDA’s Office of Policy in the Office of the Commissioner, in consultation with FDA’s Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research, Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research, Center for Devices and Radiological
Health, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Center for Tobacco Products, Center for Veterinary
Medicine, National Center for Toxicological Research, Office of the Chief Scientist, Office of Foods and Veterinary
Medicine, Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of Special Medical Programs, and Nanotechnology Task Force.

range and certain materials that otherwise exhibit related dimension-dependent properties or
phenomena. Use of these terms is for the purpose of communicating FDA’s current thinking
elaborated in this document only.

As used in this guidance, the word “products” (or “FDA-regulated products”) is meant to include
products, materials, ingredients, and other substances regulated by FDA, including drugs,
biological products, medical devices, food substances (including food for animals), dietary
supplements, cosmetic products, and tobacco products.[2]

The guidance describes FDA’s current thinking on determining whether FDA-regulated products
involve the application of nanotechnology. This guidance is intended for manufacturers,
suppliers, importers, and other stakeholders. (For convenience, the guidance will refer to these
parties as “industry.”) FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish
legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe FDA’s current
thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or
statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents
means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

The application of nanotechnology may result in product attributes that differ from those of
conventionally-manufactured products, and thus may merit particular examination. However,
FDA (or “we”) does not categorically judge all products that involve the application of
nanotechnology as intrinsically benign or harmful. FDA will regulate nanotechnology products
under existing statutory authorities, in accordance with the specific legal standards applicable to
each type of product under its jurisdiction. We consider the current framework for safety
assessment sufficiently robust and flexible to be appropriate for a variety of materials, including
nanomaterials. FDA maintains a product-focused, science-based regulatory policy. Technical
assessments will be product-specific, taking into account the effects of nanomaterials in the
particular biological and mechanical context of each product and its intended use. As such, the
particular policies for each product area, both substantive and procedural, will vary according to
the statutory authorities and relevant regulatory frameworks (Ref. 8). We believe that this
regulatory policy allows for tailored approaches that adhere to applicable legal frameworks and
reflect the characteristics of specific products or product classes and evolving technology and
scientific understanding.

This guidance provides an overarching framework for FDA’s approach to the regulation of
nanotechnology products. It identifies two points to consider when determining whether the
FDA-regulated product involves the application of nanotechnology. An affirmative finding to
either of the Points to Consider, elaborated in section II below, might suggest the need for
particular attention by the Agency and/or industry to the product to identify and address potential
implications for safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status of the product.

This guidance does not address, or presuppose, what ultimate regulatory outcome, if any, will
result in a particular case where the use of these points may indicate that an FDA-regulated
product involves the application of nanotechnology. Issues such as the safety, effectiveness,

2 Nanotechnology may also be applied to combination products (as defined at 21 CFR 3.2(e)).

public health impact, or the regulatory status of nanotechnology products are currently addressed
on a case-by-case basis using FDA’s existing review processes.[3]

This guidance also does not establish regulatory definitions. Rather, it is intended to help
industry and others identify when they should consider potential implications for regulatory
status, safety, effectiveness, or public health impact that may arise with the application of
nanotechnology in FDA-regulated products. We advise industry to consult with FDA early in
the development process to facilitate a mutual understanding of the specific scientific and
regulatory issues for their nanotechnology products.

FDA will provide further guidance to industry, as needed, to address the application of
nanotechnology as applicable to specific FDA-regulated products or classes of products (such as
human foods, drugs, or cosmetics), consistent with existing federal policies (Refs. 9, 10). As
appropriate, FDA’s product-specific guidance documents will address issues such as the
regulatory status, safety, effectiveness, performance, quality, or public health impact of
nanotechnology products.[4]

**II.** **DISCUSSION**

FDA has not established regulatory definitions of “nanotechnology,” “nanomaterial,”
“nanoscale,” or other related terms. These terms are commonly used in relation to the
engineering (i.e., deliberate manipulation, manufacture or selection) of materials that have at
least one dimension in the size range of approximately 1 nanometers (nm) to 100 nm. For
example, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Program defines nanotechnology as “the
understanding and control of matter at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100
nanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications” (Ref. 11). Various published
definitions mention other factors such as function, shape, charge, the ratio of surface area to
volume, or other physical or chemical properties.

Based on our current scientific and technical understanding of nanomaterials and their
characteristics, FDA believes that evaluations of safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or
regulatory status of nanotechnology products should consider any unique properties and
behaviors that the application of nanotechnology may impart. This guidance identifies two
Points to Consider that should be used to evaluate whether FDA-regulated products involve the
application of nanotechnology. These points address both particle dimensions and dimensiondependent properties or phenomena. Product-specific premarket review, when required, offers
an opportunity for FDA to apply these points and, where products are not subject to premarket
review, industry should consider these points. If either point applies to a given product, industry

3 It bears noting that the application of nanotechnology may also affect the classification of a product. For example,
nanomaterials used in medical products may function through different modes of action than larger-scale materials
with the same chemical composition, which may affect the classification of the product, for example as a drug or
device.

on nanotechnology applications in specific product sectors, can be found at:

and FDA should consider whether the evaluations of safety, effectiveness, public health impact,
or regulatory status of that product have identified and adequately addressed any unique
properties or behaviors of the product.

These two Points to Consider are intended to provide an initial screening tool that can be broadly
applied to all FDA-regulated products, with the understanding that these points are subject to
change in the future as new information becomes available. In particular, FDA may further
refine these points, either as applicable broadly to all FDA-regulated products or as applicable to
particular products or classes of products, as justified by scientific information. This may
include refining particle size parameters or introducing additional parameters such as those
related to particle size distribution or specific properties.[5] We will consider future revisions to
our approach, including developing regulatory definitions relevant to nanotechnology, as
warranted and in keeping with evolving scientific understanding. As previously indicated, FDA
also may provide additional guidance, including product-specific guidance documents, to address
issues such as the regulatory status, safety, effectiveness, performance, quality, or public health
impact of nanotechnology products.

**A.** **Points to Consider**

At this time, when considering whether an FDA-regulated product involves the application of
nanotechnology, FDA will ask:

1. Whether a material or end product is engineered to have at least one external dimension, or
an internal or surface structure, in the nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to 100 nm);

In addition, as we explain in more detail below, because materials or end products can also
exhibit related properties or phenomena attributable to a dimension(s) outside the nanoscale
range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm that are relevant to evaluations of safety, effectiveness,
performance, quality, public health impact, or regulatory status of products, we will also ask:

2. Whether a material or end product is engineered to exhibit properties or phenomena,
including physical or chemical properties or biological effects, that are attributable to its
dimension(s), even if these dimensions fall outside the nanoscale range, up to one
micrometer (1,000 nm).[6]

5 At this time, we do not have an adequate basis on which to determine a particle number threshold or a list of
“unique” or “novel” properties that are applicable across the range of FDA-regulated products. In addition,
challenges related to measurement methods and biological effects add further complexity to recommending use of
particle number, weight, or surface area as the most appropriate units of measure. FDA intends to actively follow
scientific developments on this issue and provide additional guidance, as appropriate.
6 As explained in section II.B.5. below, the use of 1,000 nm as a reference point should not be interpreted to mean
that materials or products with dimensions above 1,000 nm cannot exhibit dimension-dependent properties or
phenomena of importance to safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status of the material or
product. See further discussion on this issue in section II.B.5. below.

## Page 201

These considerations apply not only to new products, but also when changes to manufacturing
processes alter the dimensions, properties, or effects of an FDA-regulated product or any of its
constituent parts.[7]

**B.** **Rationale for Elements within the Points to Consider**

1. Material or end product that is engineered to have certain dimensions or exhibit
certain properties (in Points 1 and 2)

The term “engineered,” used in both Points 1 and 2, is used to distinguish products that have
been deliberately manipulated by the application of nanotechnology from those products that
contain materials that naturally occur in the nanoscale range. FDA is particularly interested in
the deliberate and purposeful manipulation and control of dimensions to produce specific
properties, because the emergence of these new properties or phenomena may raise questions
about the safety, effectiveness, performance, quality or public health impact that may warrant
further evaluation. FDA’s interest in materials or products “engineered” to have nanoscale
dimensions or related dimension-dependent properties or phenomena is distinct from the more
familiar use of biological or chemical substances that may naturally exist at small scales,
including at the nanoscale, such as microorganisms or proteins.

The term “engineered” is also used to distinguish products that have been deliberately
manipulated by the application of nanotechnology from products that may unintentionally
include materials in the nanoscale range.
For example, the incidental presence of particles in the nanoscale range in conventionallymanufactured products[8] is not covered under the scope of this guidance.[9]

2. Material or end product (in Points 1 and 2)

The phrase “material or end product,” referred to in both Points 1 and 2, is used to cover
different types of articles that are regulated by FDA, such as products, materials, ingredients, and
other substances regulated by FDA. This includes finished products (e.g., a drug tablet for
administration to a patient) as well as materials that are intended for use in a finished product
(e.g., a food additive added to a food during processing). In determining whether a material or
end product satisfies either Point 1 or Point 2, FDA will examine the material or end product,
and may also consider the constituent parts of the material or end product. Therefore, relevant
considerations include whether a material or end product contains or involves in its manufacture
the use of materials that meet either Point 1 or Point 2.

7 These Points to Consider are not intended to apply to products that have been previously reviewed or approved by
FDA and where no changes are made to manufacturing processes that would alter the dimensions, properties or
effects of the product or its constituent parts.
8 For example, small amounts of particles in the nanoscale range have been reported to be present in foods
manufactured using conventional food manufacturing practices (Ref. 12).
9 However, evaluations of conventionally-manufactured products may include a consideration of the effects, if any,
of such incidental presence of particles in the nanoscale range on the safety, effectiveness, or public health impact of
a product.

3. At least one external dimension, or an internal or surface structure, in the
nanoscale range (approximately 1 nm to 100 nm) (in Point 1)

A size range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm is commonly used in various working definitions
or descriptions regarding nanotechnology proposed by the regulatory and scientific
community.[10] In this size range, materials can exhibit new or altered physicochemical properties
that can enable novel applications (Refs. 11, 13-15). Accordingly, per Point 1, if a material or
end product is engineered to have at least one external dimension in the range of 1 nm to 100 nm,
or is engineered to have an internal or surface structure in the range of 1 nm to 100 nm, industry
and FDA should consider any unique characteristics or biological effects exhibited by the
product that may influence its safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status.
Primary particles engineered with at least one external dimension within the nanoscale range are
covered in Point 1. This Point also covers any aggregates or agglomerates formed by such
nanoscale primary particles. In addition, coated, functionalized, or hierarchically-assembled
engineered structures that include internal or surface discrete and functional nanoscale entities,
such as where such entities are embedded or attached to the surface, are encompassed within
Point 1.[11] Such engineered structures with discrete and functional nanoscale entities embedded
or attached to the surface may have altered properties or phenomena that may affect product
safety or effectiveness (Ref. 16). The inclusion of particles, objects, or structures with internal,
surface, or external dimension(s) in the nanoscale range is consistent with approaches taken by
other scientific and regulatory bodies (Refs. 17-23).

4. Properties or phenomena attributable to dimension(s) (in Point 2)

While size alone, for very small particles, is suggestive of the presence of properties meriting
further examination, the identification and assessment of specific dimension-dependent
properties and phenomena are ultimately more relevant for purposes of FDA regulatory review
and oversight. Point 2, therefore, focuses on the properties of the material and its behavior in
biological systems.[12] The phrase “exhibits properties or phenomena . . . that are attributable to
its dimension(s),” is used because properties and phenomena of materials in the nanoscale range
enable applications that can affect the safety, effectiveness, performance, quality, public health
impact, or regulatory status of FDA-regulated products. For example, as noted above,
dimension-dependent properties or phenomena may be used for various functional effects such
as increased bioavailability or decreased toxicity of drug products, better detection of pathogens,

10 For example, a size range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm is used in definitions, working definitions, or
descriptions published by the National Nanotechnology Initiative (Ref. 11); Environmental Protection Agency

nanoscale range that may be present in conventionally-manufactured substances (for example, internal porosity,
surface roughness or surface defects).

improved food packaging materials, or improved delivery of nutrients. These effects may derive
from altered or unique characteristics of materials in the nanoscale range that are not normally
observed or expected in larger-scale materials with the same chemical composition (Ref. 7).
However, such changes may raise questions about the safety, effectiveness, performance, quality
or public health impact of nanotechnology products. In addition, considerations such as routes of
exposure, dosage, and behavior in various biological systems (including specific tissues and
organs) (Refs. 13, 24) are critical for evaluating the safety, effectiveness, public health impact, or
regulatory status of a wide array of products under FDA’s jurisdiction. Such evaluations should
include a consideration of the specific tests (whether traditional, modified, or new) that may be
needed (Refs. 25, 26) to determine the physicochemical properties and biological effects of a
product that involves the application of nanotechnology.

5. Dimension(s) of up to one micrometer (1,000 nm) (in Point 2)

Materials or end products can also exhibit properties or phenomena attributable to a dimension(s)
outside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm. Physical and chemical properties
and biological behavior that are relevant to evaluations of safety, effectiveness, performance,
quality, public health impact, or regulatory status of products have been observed at dimensions
outside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm (Refs. 27-30). Therefore, Point 2
focuses on the importance of considering properties or phenomena attributable to dimensions,
even where such dimensions may be outside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100
nm. FDA’s consideration of materials with dimension(s) outside the nanoscale range of
approximately 1 nm to 100 nm is consistent with approaches taken by other scientific and
regulatory organizations.[13]

13 For example, the Joint Research Centre and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health
Risks of the European Commission concluded: “In order to base a nanomaterials definition for regulatory purposes
on size alone, the upper nanoscale limit should ideally be high enough to capture all types of materials that would
need particular attention for regulation due to their nanoscale size. Upper limits which are often used in existing
definitions, for example 100 nm, may require the introduction of one or more qualifiers based on structural features
or properties other than size, in order to capture structures of concern (for example agglomerates or aggregates) with
a size larger than 100 nm in the regulation” (Ref. 22); “The upper size limit for one or more external dimensions of
100 nm is complicated by the potential exclusion of aggregates, agglomerates and multicomponent assemblies that
would have external sizes greater than this” (Ref. 23); and “An upper limit of 100 nm is commonly used by general
consensus but there is no scientific evidence to support the appropriateness of this value (Stated as SCENIHR
conclusions in the European Commission Recommendation on the definition of nanomaterial, Ref. 17). The
European Commission further noted that “it may be necessary to include additional materials, such as some
materials with a size . . . greater than 100 nm in the scope of application of specific legislation or legislative
provisions suited for a nanomaterial (Ref. 17). In addition, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
“acknowledged that health and safety considerations associated with intentionally produced and incidental nanoobjects do not abruptly end at dimensions of 100 nm. As knowledge expands, it is abundantly clear that a robust
terminology will need to capture and convey effectively the performance aspects of intentionally produced nanoobjects and nanostructured materials in their definitions, apart from their fundamental size and shape” (Ref. 20).
More recently, Health Canada adopted a working definition of nanomaterial that, in part, reflects that it is possible
for nanoscale properties/ phenomena to be exhibited outside the 1 nm to 100 nm size range, such as select quantum
devices (Ref. 19). Finally, in its second regulatory review on nanomaterials, the European Commission noted that
“fullerenes, graphene flakes and single wall carbon nanotubes with one or more external dimensions below 1 nm
should be considered as nanomaterials.” Several types of nanomaterials were identified as not matching the EU
definition, with an acknowledgment that “there are an increasing number of particles which are engineered to have
internal nanoscale features. Examples are core-shell particles and nano-encapsulates. These particles may be
designed, for example for pharmaceutical applications, where the inner core particle is “released” in a certain

At the present time, available scientific information does not establish a uniform upper boundary
above 100 nm where novel properties and phenomena similar to those seen in materials with
dimensions in the nanoscale range cease for all potential materials or end products. For this
reason, at this time, FDA finds it reasonable to consider evaluation of materials or end products
engineered to exhibit properties or phenomena attributable to dimensions up to 1,000 nm, as a
means to screen materials for further examination and to determine whether these materials
exhibit properties or phenomena attributable to their dimension(s) and associated with the
application of nanotechnology.[14] An upper limit of one micrometer (1,000 nm) applied in the
context of properties or phenomena attributable to dimensions serves both to: (1) include
materials with dimension(s) outside the nanoscale range of approximately 1 nm to 100 nm that
may exhibit dimension-dependent properties or phenomena associated with the application of
nanotechnology and distinct from those of macro-scaled materials; and (2) exclude macro-scaled
materials that may have properties attributable to their dimension(s) but are not likely associated
with the application of nanotechnology.

An upper limit of 1,000 nm, combined with the presence of dimension-dependent properties or
phenomena similar to those seen in materials with dimensions in the nanoscale range, provides
an initial screening tool to help identify materials or products with properties or phenomena of
particular relevance for regulatory review. The use of 1,000 nm as a reference point in this
context should not be interpreted to mean that materials or products with dimensions above
1,000 nm cannot exhibit dimension-dependent properties or phenomena of importance to safety,
effectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status of the material or product. As noted
above, we may further refine these Points to Consider, including this upper limit, either as
applicable broadly to FDA-regulated products or as applicable to specific products or product
categories.

**III.** **CONCLUSION**

The two Points to Consider elaborated in this guidance should be applied when considering
whether an FDA-regulated product involves the application of nanotechnology. An affirmative
finding to either of the Points to Consider, elaborated in this guidance, might suggest the need for
particular attention to the product by FDA and/or industry for potential implications for safety,
effectiveness, public health impact, or regulatory status of the product. We will consider future
revisions to our approach, including developing regulatory definitions relevant to
nanotechnology, as warranted and in keeping with evolving scientific understanding.

There remains a need to learn more about the potential role and importance of dimensions in the
physical and chemical characteristics and biological effects exhibited by FDA-regulated products

environment. Some of these materials have an external diameter smaller than 100 nm, matching the EU
nanomaterial definition, others have an external diameter larger than 100 nm, not matching the EU nanomaterial
definition” (Ref. 31).
14 However, as noted previously, FDA will consider further refinement of these Points to Consider for particular
products or classes of products, as scientific information becomes available, including refining particle size
parameters.

that involve the application of nanotechnology.[15] Product-specific premarket review, when
required, offers an opportunity for FDA to better understand the properties and behavior of
products that involve the application of nanotechnology. Where products that involve the
application of nanotechnology are not subject to premarket review, we urge industry to consult
with the Agency early in the product development process. In this way, any questions about the
products’ regulatory status, safety, effectiveness, or public health impact can be appropriately
and adequately addressed. FDA has and, as needed, will continue to provide additional guidance
to industry in more targeted guidance documents to address these considerations.

###### Questions and Answers Regarding Collecting and Providing 702(b) Portions of FDA Official Samples

 Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff

_This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug_
_Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person_
_and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the_
_requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach,_
_contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page._

**INTRODUCTION**

This draft guidance is intended to assist FDA staff and industry with issues and questions related
to the requirements for FDA to collect and provide portions of official samples under section
702(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and its implementing regulation
in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 2.10 (21 CFR 2.10).

The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant
to bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This
document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements
under the law. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The
use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

**BACKGROUND**

Section 702 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 372) authorizes FDA to conduct examinations and
investigations and to collect samples.[1] Collecting samples is a critical part of FDA's regulatory
activities. Under section 702(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 372(b)), when FDA collects a
sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis, FDA must, “upon request, provide a part of
such official sample for examination or analysis by any person named on the label of the article,
or the owner thereof, or his attorney or agent” (hereinafter referred to as “owner”). Section
702(b) of the FD&C Act also authorizes FDA to establish, by regulation, “reasonable exceptions

1 Courts have recognized that the plain language of section 702(b) of the FD&C Act authorizes sampling. See, e.g.,
_United States v. 75 cases, etc., 146 F.2d 124 (4[th] Cir. 1944)._

from, and impose such reasonable terms and conditions relating to” the requirements of section
702(b) of the FD&C Act, as necessary for the proper administration of the provisions of the
FD&C Act.

FDA’s regulation at 21 CFR 2.10 was established to describe those reasonable terms and
conditions to implement section 702(b) of the FD&C Act. The regulation provides a definition
for official sample, states when FDA must collect and provide a part of the official sample
(hereinafter referred to as the 702(b) portion) to the owner, and states when FDA may destroy
the official sample, among other things. The regulation also provides exceptions to the
requirement for FDA to collect and provide a 702(b) portion of an official sample to the owner.

**A.** **TERMINOLOGY**

**1.** **What is a 702(b) portion?**

FDA uses the term 702(b) portion to refer to the part of FDA’s official sample of a food, drug, or
cosmetic that FDA is required to provide to the owner, upon request under section 702(b) of the
FD&C Act. FDA will collect and provide a 702(b) portion in accordance with 702(b) of the
FD&C Act and its implementing regulation in 21 CFR 2.10.

**2.** **What is an official sample?**

A sample collected by an officer or employee of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) is an official sample if records or other evidence is obtained by the officer or
employee or any other officer or employee of HHS indicating that the shipment or other lot of
the article from which the sample is collected was introduced or delivered for introduction into
interstate commerce, or was in or was received in interstate commerce, or was manufactured
within a Territory as defined in section 201(a)(2) of the FD&C Act. 21 CFR 2.10(a)(1). The
officer or employee of HHS must designate such sample as an official sample for it to be
considered one. 21 CFR 2.10(a)(1). FDA personnel can refer to FDA’s Investigations
Operations Manual (IOM), Chapter 4, for instructions related to official samples.

**3.** **What is a food, drug, or cosmetic?**

The FD&C Act defines food, drug, and cosmetic in pertinent part as:

  - Food means “(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing
gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article” (section 201(f)); For
example,


-----

## Page 214

_Draft – Not for Implementation_

`o` A dietary supplement is deemed to be food (section 201(ff))[2]
`o` A food additive is a component of food (section 201(s)).

  - Drug means “(A) articles recognized in the official United States Pharmacopoeia, official
Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, or official National Formulary, or
any supplement to any of them; and (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure,
mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (C) articles
(other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or
other animals; and (D) articles intended for use as a component of any article specified in
clause (A), (B), or (C)” (section 201(g)(1)).[3]

  - Cosmetic means “(1) articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on,
introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing,
beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and (2) articles intended
for use as a component of any such articles; except that such term shall not include soap”
(section 201(i)).

FDA occasionally performs environmental sampling (e.g. swabbing of facilities or equipment) to
identify the presence of chemicals or microbes where food, drugs, or cosmetics are produced.
These environmental samples do not meet the definitions of food, drug, or cosmetic.

**B.** **QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS**

**1.** **When must FDA collect a 702(b) portion?**

FDA must collect a 702(b) portion when an officer or employee of HHS collects an official
sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis under the FD&C Act, unless an exception in 21
CFR 2.10(b) applies (See B.3.).

**i.** **Must a commissioned state or local official collect a 702(b) portion**
**when collecting an official sample?**

2 Section 201(ff)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)) excludes from the definition of a dietary
supplement a product that contains an article that was the subject of an investigational new drug exemption, new
drug application, or biologics license application 1) approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act,
certified as an antibiotic under 507 of the FD&C Act, or licensed as a biologic under section 351 of the Public
Health Service Act, or 2) investigated as a new drug, antibiotic or biologic for which substantial clinical
investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public; and
which was not before such approval, certification, licensing, or authorization marketed as a dietary supplement or as
a food unless the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, has issued a regulation, after notice and comment, finding
that the article would be lawful under the FD&C Actprior to its marketing as a dietary supplement.
3 A biological product, as defined in section 351(i)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), that is also
regulated as a drug under the FD&C Act’s drug provisions is subject to section 702(b) (see section 351(j) of the PHS
Act), as is a combination product that is subject to premarket approval under the FD&C Act’s drug provisions or the
PHS Act’s biologics licensing provisions.

Section 702(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act authorizes the Secretary of HHS to conduct examinations
and inspections through officers and employees of HHS or through certain officers and
employees of states, territories, and political subdivisions who have been duly commissioned as
an officer of HHS. Under section 702(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, state and local officials duly
commissioned by FDA are considered officers of HHS when conducting examinations or
investigations under contract or agreement for purposes of the FD&C Act. Thus, a
commissioned state or local officer or employee who collects an official sample of a food, drug,
or cosmetic for analysis under the FD&C Act must collect a 702(b) portion, as required by 21
CFR 2.10(b). This guidance uses the terms “FDA staff” and “FDA investigator” to refer to an
HHS officer or employee, including a commissioned state or local officer or employee.

**ii.** **Should FDA collect a 702(b) portion if documentation of interstate**
**commerce is not immediately available?**

An FDA investigator must collect a 702(b) portion for an official sample, unless an exception
applies. (See 21 CFR 2.10(a)(1) and section A.2. of this guidance for the meaning of official
sample, which includes, among other things, evidence of interstate commerce.)

In some situations, such as a retail setting or as part of FDA’s surveillance activities, records or
evidence of interstate commerce may not be immediately available at the time of the sample
collection. However, if FDA has reason to believe that the product was introduced into or in
interstate commerce and expects to obtain evidence of interstate commerce at a later time, FDA
should collect a 702(b) portion for the sample.

**iii.** **What common types of samples does FDA collect that do not require a**
**702(b) portion?**

FDA is not required to collect or provide a 702(b) portion for samples of products that are not
foods, drugs, or cosmetics as defined by the FD&C Act. (21 U.S.C. 372(b); 21 CFR 2.10(b)).
See section A.3 of this guidance for the definitions of food, drug, and cosmetic. For example,
FDA is not required to collect a 702(b) portion for a sample that is a medical device or a tobacco
product.

Other examples of samples collected by FDA that are not a food, drug, or cosmetic and thus are
not subject to section 702(b) of the FD&C Act include filth exhibits that are not tied to or
connected to a specific lot of product used to illustrate conditions at an establishment (e.g.,
rodent excreta pellets) and samples collected from equipment or surfaces to demonstrate the
environmental conditions of an establishment. However, unless an exception in 21 CFR 2.10(b)
applies, FDA must collect a 702(b) portion when collecting an official sample of a food, drug, or
cosmetic that is associated with the filth or the environmental sample.

**2.** **What are the exceptions to 702(b) portion collection?**

An FDA investigator who is collecting an official sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for
analysis under the FD&C Act must collect at least twice the quantity estimated to be sufficient
for analysis, unless one of the following exceptions in 21 CFR 2.10(b) applies:

(1) The amount of the article available and reasonably accessible for sampling is less than
twice the quantity so estimated, in which case the FDA investigator must collect as much
as is available and reasonably accessible.

_Considerations: For some samples, such as when FDA is collecting an official sample_
from retail, rather than from the owner, the amount of the article available and reasonably
accessible for sampling is less than twice the quantity estimated to be sufficient for
analysis. Also, FDA may receive product from a consumer that the consumer alleges
violates the FD&C Act in some respect. The consumer may have a limited portion of the
article that is not sufficient to include a 702(b) portion. In these and other situations for
which twice the quantity sufficient for analysis is not available, FDA should collect as
much of the article that is available and reasonably accessible.

(2) The cost of twice the quantity so estimated exceeds $150.

_Considerations:  If the cost of twice the quantity exceeds $150, FDA investigators_
should consult with their supervisors (see IOM, Chapter 4).

(3) The sample cannot by diligent use of practicable preservation techniques available to
FDA be kept in a state in which it could be readily and meaningfully analyzed in the
same manner and for the same purposes as FDA’s analysis.

_Considerations: Whether the sample can be so preserved and analyzed may depend on_
the product from which the sample was taken. For example, some FDA products, such as
fresh produce, are highly perishable and cannot be kept in a state that allows for
meaningful analysis in the same manner and for the same purpose as the FDA’s analysis.

(4) The sample is collected from a shipment or other lot which is being imported or
offered for import into the United States.

(5) The sample is collected from a person named on the label of the article or his agent,
and such person is also the owner of the article.

(6) The sample is collected from the owner of the article, or his agent, and such article
bears no label or, if it bears a label, no person is named thereon.

For exceptions (5) and (6), while FDA is not required to collect a 702(b) portion, the owners or
their agents may decide at their own discretion to collect a sample to duplicate FDA’s sample.
Such sampling by owners or their agents is outside the scope of this guidance.

_Draft – Not for Implementation_

FDA may collect a 702(b) portion even if an exception applies. For example, if an official
sample of an imported article, or article offered for import, is collected for use in an anticipated
legal action (e.g., seizure under section 304 of the FD&C Act), FDA may collect a 702(b)
portion.

**3.** **When FDA receives a food, drug, or cosmetic as part of a consumer complaint,**
**should FDA collect a 702(b) portion?**

Yes, when collecting an official sample from a consumer as part of a consumer complaint, FDA
should take reasonable efforts to collect a 702(b) portion if one is available and no exceptions
apply.

**4.** **Does FDA collect the 702(b) portion as a separate subsample?**

FDA is not required to collect the 702(b) portion as a separate subsample. In some situations,
when collecting, FDA may not be able to collect a separate subsample that will be used as the
702(b) portion of the official sample.

However, whenever possible, FDA may collect a separate subsample in order to provide the
owner a 702(b) portion. See IOM Chapter 4. If FDA does not collect separate subsamples, FDA
will collect a single sample at least twice the amount estimated to be sufficient for analysis
unless an exception applies. (21 CFR 2.10(b)).

**5.** **When must FDA provide a 702(b) portion?**

21 CFR 2.10(c) establishes when FDA must provide a 702(b) portion to the owner of the
sampled product. Under 2.10(c), after FDA has completed all analysis of an official sample of a
food, drug, or cosmetic needed to determine whether the product is adulterated or misbranded, or
otherwise subject to the prohibitions of the FD&C Act, and has reserved an amount of the article
it estimates to be adequate for use as exhibits in the trial of any case that may arise based on the
sample, a part of the sample, if any remains available, must be provided for analysis upon written
request, by the owner, unless an exception applies.

**i.** **If the only portion of the official sample that remains after FDA**
**analysis is the amount reserved by FDA for use at trial, must FDA**
**provide that portion to the owner?**

No, FDA is not required to give a 702(b) portion to the owner if none remains after reserving an
adequate amount for trial. Under such situations, FDA is not required to provide to the owner
the portion reserved by FDA for use at trial. (21 CFR 2.10(c)).


-----

## Page 218

_Draft – Not for Implementation_

**ii.** **If a portion of an official sample remains after FDA analysis and**
**reserving an amount for use at trial, must FDA provide part of the**
**sample upon written request by the owner?**

Yes, FDA must provide a portion of the official sample to the owner if any remains after
reserving an amount for trial upon written request by the owner. (21 CFR 2.10(c)).

**iii.** **If the sample was collected from a consumer as part of a consumer**
**complaint, must FDA provide a part of the sample to the consumer?**

In some consumer complaint situations, there is potential for litigation between the consumer and
the firm, in addition to any action FDA may be considering. In such situations, both the firm and
the consumer may request a part of the sample.

FDA is required to provide a 702(b) portion if, in part, the request is from any person named on
the label of the article, or the owner thereof, or the attorney or agent of such person or owner. (21
U.S.C. 372(b)). 21 CFR 2.10(a)(3) states that the “owner of a food, drug, or cosmetic of which
an official sample is collected is the person who owns the shipment or other lot of the article
from which the sample is collected.” FDA may consider providing a portion of a sample to a
consumer who is not an owner but such portion is outside the scope of this guidance, and FDA
must prioritize providing a sample to persons entitled to a 702(b) portion under the FD&C Act.

**6.** **If FDA is required to provide a 702(b) portion, how much should FDA provide?**

21 CFR 2.10(c) states, in part, that FDA must provide “a part of the sample” to the owner upon
written requests, unless an exception applies. The amount of a sample that remains for providing
a 702(b) portion depends on the amount of sample collected, the amount of the sample used for
the analysis, and the amount of the sample reserved for trial. The amount reserved for trial is
what FDA estimates to be adequate for use as exhibits in the trial of any case that may arise
under the FD&C Act based on the sample and will be determined at FDA’s discretion.

If it is not possible to provide the amount requested by the owner, FDA should consult with the
owner to determine how much of the remaining sample the owner may want as a 702(b) portion.

**7.** **If FDA collected one or more separate subsamples as the 702(b) portion, but the**
**owner requests a portion of the subsample FDA used for the sample analysis,**
**should FDA provide the portion the owner requested?**

Although not required, FDA’s practice is to, whenever reasonable, collect separate subsamples to
serve as the 702(b) portion. Also see section B.5.

If FDA collected a separate subsample as the 702(b) portion but the owner requests a portion
from the subsample FDA used for analysis, FDA may provide the owner the portion from the
source requested, if any remains available after analysis and reserving an amount adequate for

use at trial. FDA Divisions receiving such requests may consult within FDA about the
circumstances pertaining to the request.

**8.** **How long should a 702(b) portion be retained?**

FDA should retain the 702(b) portion until it is authorized to destroy it. Under 21 CFR 2.10(e),
FDA is authorized to destroy an official sample, including the 702(b) portion, as follows:

a. FDA determines that no analysis of the sample will be made;
b. FDA determines that no notice under section 305 of the FD&C Act and no case under the
FD&C Act, is or will be based on the sample;
c. The sample was the basis of a notice under section 305 of the FD&C Act and, after
opportunity for presentation of views following such notice, FDA determines that no
other such notice, and no case under the FD&C Act, is or will be based on the sample;
d. The sample was the basis of a case under the FD&C Act that has gone to final judgment,
and FDA has determined that no other such case is or will be based on the sample;
e. The sampled article is perishable;
f. The sample is decomposed or otherwise unfit for analysis;
g. The part of the sample that will be destroyed is in excess of three times the quantity FDA
estimates to be sufficient for analysis.

**9.** **Can FDA use 702(b) portions of a sample for research purposes?**

Yes, FDA may use an official sample, including the 702(b) portion, for research purposes,
provided that the conditions for destruction under 21 CFR 2.10(e) are met. In such situations,
because FDA has met the conditions for destruction, the owner is no longer entitled to the 702(b)
portion of the sample.

**10.** **How should the owner request a 702(b) portion?**

The owner should send a request for the 702(b) portion of an official sample to the FDA
Division[4] of the officer or employee who collected the sample. The request can be addressed to
the Division’s Director of Compliance.[5] The request for a 702(b) portion must be in writing
(e.g., electronic mail or letter) and be accompanied by either a showing of ownership of the
sample or the authority to receive the sample on behalf of the owner (21 CFR 2.10(c)). The
request should also include relevant details regarding the sample (e.g., the lot, serial number,
model number, or other identification of the sampled product). The owner who requests the
702(b) portion must specify the amount desired. (21 CFR 2.10(c)(2)). In addition to the request,

4 FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) staff are assigned to program areas, where they specialize in a
[commodity. Each program area is organized by Divisions. See https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/office-regulatory-](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/office-regulatory-affairs/ora-program-division-boundary-maps-and-fact-sheets)

the owner should, if available, provide a copy of the Form FDA 484 Receipt for Samples issued
by the collecting officer or employee to the responsible individual from whom the sample was
collected to facilitate FDA’s identification of the sample that was collected (see IOM, Chapter 4
for a copy of Form FDA 484).

In responding to the request, the FDA Division for the officer or employee who collected the
sample may consult, as needed, with ORA’s Office of Regulatory Science, FDA’s Office of
Chief Counsel, the appropriate FDA Center, the laboratory holding the 702(b) portion, as well as
the Division in which the officer or employee is located, if different from the Division that
collected the sample.

 Guidance for Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators, Researchers, Industry, and Food and Drug Administration Staff

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on
this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You
can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.
To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the
title page.

**I.  Introduction**

This guidance[1] describes FDA implementation of the revised provisions applicable to the request
for, and issuance of, a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC). The 21[st] Century Cures Act (Cures
Act) (Public Law 114-255) amended the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), section 301(d)
(42 U.S.C. 241(d)) relating to the issuance of CoCs. A CoC is intended to help protect the
privacy of human subject research participants from whom identifiable, sensitive information is
being collected or used in furtherance of the research.[2] Historically, a CoC generally protected a
researcher from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive information about the research
participant, created or compiled for purposes of the human subject research. As amended, the
statute broadened the protections by affirmatively prohibiting holders of CoCs from disclosing
such information unless a specific exception applies.

The Cures Act simplified certain aspects of the issuance of CoCs by requiring that CoCs be
issued for federally-funded human subject research that collects or uses identifiable, sensitive
information (referred to in this guidance as mandatory CoCs). For non-federally funded
research, issuance of CoCs is not required but may be issued at the discretion of FDA (referred to
in this guidance as discretionary CoCs). FDA intends to continue receiving and considering such
requests and will issue discretionary CoCs as appropriate. This guidance is intended to provide
information on how to request a discretionary CoC, the statutory requirements for requesting
such a CoC, and the statutory responsibilities associated with possessing a CoC. Although the
mandatory CoC and the discretionary CoC are issued under different processes, the protections

and Research, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the
Center for Tobacco Products, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, the Center for Veterinary Medicine,
and the Office of Chief Scientist at the Food and Drug Administration.

are outside the scope of this guidance.

afforded by the issuance of either CoC are identical and the statutory responsibilities are the
same.

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

**II. Background**

A CoC generally protects a researcher from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive
information about the research participant, created or compiled for purposes of the research, in
any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding. As
amended, the statute broadened these protections by prohibiting disclosure of such information.
By protecting researchers from being compelled to disclose identifiable, sensitive information
about the research participants, CoCs help protect the identity of the research participants and
achieve the objectives of the research. There are exceptions to the prohibition on disclosure as
described in Section III of this guidance.

FDA has the authority (by delegation) to issue CoCs related to the study of products subject to
FDA jurisdiction and to which FDA regulations apply, in compliance with the PHS Act, and has
done so for over 20 years. (42 U.S.C. § 241)[3] The Cures Act revisions made issuance of a CoC
mandatory for federally funded researchers “engaged in biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other
research, in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected (including research on mental
health and research on the use and effect of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs).” For non_federally funded research, FDA “may, upon application by a person engaged in research, issue to_
such person a certificate of confidentiality to protect the privacy of such individuals (emphases
added) . . . .”

The Cures Act also directed agencies to take steps to minimize the burden to researchers,
streamline the process, and reduce the time it takes to comply with the requirements of the
statutory provision. FDA has complied with this directive in implementing requirements for the
issuance of mandatory CoCs to FDA-federally funded researchers.

For non-federally funded research, FDA has been issuing discretionary CoCs pursuant to the
amended statutory requirements, on a case-by-case basis upon application to FDA, since
enactment of the Cures Act. This guidance describes the revised, streamlined process for
submission to FDA of requests for discretionary CoCs for non-federally funded research. The
revised process for discretionary CoCs will minimize the burden to researchers who request a
CoC, will streamline the existing process by reducing the information currently provided in a
request to FDA for a CoC, will clarify the statutory responsibilities associated with receiving a
CoC and, thus, will reduce the time it takes to obtain a CoC.

3 FDA, by delegation from the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has the authority to
issue CoCs . (See, FDA Staff Manual Guide, 1410.26(1)(E)). Other HHS agencies, e.g., National Institutes of
Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also issue CoCs.

## Page 226

**III. Scope**

To help ensure that discretionary CoCs are issued to those entities who can comply with the
requirements of the statutory provision, we recommend that only sponsors or sponsorinvestigators, submit requests for discretionary CoCs (as defined in 21 CFR §50.3, §312.3,
§812.3) (i.e., the individual who takes responsibility for or initiates the clinical investigation).
This will help eliminate duplicative requests to FDA for the same human subject research. It is
our understanding that, typically, sponsors and sponsor-investigators are the entities or
individuals who have responsibility and control over the information and data collected and used
in research. Furthermore, the human subject research, for which a discretionary CoC is being
requested, must involve the use or study of a product subject to FDA’s jurisdiction and must be
subject to FDA’s regulatory authority.

The term “identifiable, sensitive information,” as used in section 301(d), PHS Act, and in
relation to CoCs, means “information that is about an individual and that is gathered or used
during the course of research” covered by the statute and

(A) through which an individual is identified; or (B) for which there is at least a very
small risk, as determined by current scientific practices or statistical methods, that some
combination of the information, a request for the information, and other available data
sources could be used to deduce the identity of an individual.

(42 U.S.C. § 241(d)(4)). An entity or individual requesting a discretionary CoC should evaluate
its own human subject research and make its own determination as to whether the research
involves the collection of identifiable, sensitive information (e.g., research participant names).
This evaluation should take into account the type of information collected, whether the
information is retained for any further use or purpose, the extent of the information, and the
security of the data systems that contain the information. In considering whether the individual
information being collected is “identifiable, sensitive information,” sponsors, sponsorinvestigators, and other researchers should be aware of the evolving perspectives as to the
identifiability of the information collected. Given current technological capabilities, there is
some support for the position that the identity of an individual participating in certain types of
research is relatively easy to determine even with limited de-identified data. Genomic data also
are often considered to fall automatically into the category of identifiable, sensitive information.[4]
There are various definitions of the phrase identifiable, sensitive information used by different
government agencies and for different purposes – not all necessarily applicable in this context
but which may be useful in an evaluation by the sponsors, sponsor-investigators, and other
researchers of whether certain information would fall within the statutory definition.[5] A

4 NIH considers research in which identifiable, sensitive information is collected or used, to include “research that
involves the generation of individual level, human genomic data from biospecimens, or the use of such data,
regardless of whether the data is recorded in such a manner that human subjects can be identified or the identity of
the human subjects can readily be ascertained.” (NIH, NOT-OD-17-109: Notice of Changes to NIH Policy for
Issuing Certificates of Confidentiality, effective October 1, 2017).

determination of whether any data or information collected during human subject research is
identifiable, sensitive information should be made by the sponsors or sponsor investigators.

Once a CoC is issued, the recipient must comply with the statutory disclosure protections as
follows (section 301(d)(1), PHS Act):

(A) [defines who can apply and conditions of applying for a CoC].
(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), any person to whom a certificate is issued
. . . to protect the privacy of individuals described in such subparagraph shall not disclose
or provide to any other person not connected with the research the name of such an
individual or any information, document, or biospecimen that contains identifiable,
sensitive information about such an individual and that was created or compiled for
purposes of the research.
(C) The disclosure prohibition in subparagraph (B) shall not apply to disclosure or use
that is—

(i) required by Federal, State, or local laws, excluding instances described in
subparagraph (D); (ii) necessary for the medical treatment of the individual to
whom the information, document, or biospecimen pertains and made with the
consent of such individual; (iii) made with the consent of the individual to whom
the information, document, or biospecimen pertains; or (iv) made for the purposes
of other scientific research that is in compliance with applicable Federal
regulations governing the protection of human subjects in research.
(D) Any person to whom a certificate is issued . . . to protect the privacy of an individual
described in such subparagraph shall not, in any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal,
administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, disclose or provide the name of such
individual or any such information, document, or biospecimen that contains identifiable,
sensitive information about the individual and that was created or compiled for purposes
of the research, except in the circumstance described in subparagraph (C)(iii).
(E) Identifiable, sensitive information . . ., and all copies thereof, shall be immune from
the legal process, and shall not, without the consent of the individual to whom the
information pertains, be admissible as evidence or used for any purpose in any action,
suit, or other judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding.
(F) Identifiable, sensitive information collected by a person to whom a certificate has
been issued . . ., and all copies thereof, shall be subject to the protections afforded by this
section for perpetuity.
(G) The Secretary shall take steps to minimize the burden to researchers, streamline the
process, and reduce the time it takes to comply with the requirements of this subsection.

As part of the protection of the identifiable, sensitive information collected in the research, any
other entities with whom the sponsor, sponsor-investigator, or other researcher shares the
information (i.e., “copies” of the information) are also subject to the disclosure requirements.
Such entities include contract research organizations, clinical investigators, and academic
institutions, among others.

Under FDA regulations, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a group that has been formally
designated by an institution to review, approve the initiation of, and conduct periodic review of

4


-----

## Page 228

biomedical research involving human subjects. (21 CFR §56.102(g)). In accordance with FDA
regulations, an IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or
disapprove such research. (21 CFR §56.109(a)). An IRB review serves an important role in the
protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects. If an IRB in reviewing research
determines that particular data collected in a clinical trial are sufficiently sensitive to warrant
requesting a CoC, then it is within the purview of an IRB to request that a CoC be obtained in
order to secure IRB approval. Any disagreement between an IRB, sponsor, and/or clinical
investigators, regarding the need to request a CoC for a particular study should be resolved by
appropriate communications among those parties.

**IV.  Request for Discretionary CoC From FDA**

Prior to submitting a request to FDA for issuance of a discretionary CoC, the potential requestor
should consider the following questions:

  - Is the requestor involved in human subject research in which identifiable, sensitive
information is collected?

  - Is the requestor a sponsor or sponsor-investigator or authorized representative (i.e., the
individual who takes responsibility for or initiates the clinical investigation)?

  - Does the human subject research, for which a discretionary CoC is being requested,
involve the use or study of a product subject to FDA’s jurisdiction and subject to FDA’s
regulatory authority?

  - Are the requestor’s research measures sufficient to protect the confidentiality of the
identifiable, sensitive information? [6]

We recommend that a request to FDA for the issuance of a discretionary CoC be made by those
entities and individuals that can answer “yes” to all of these questions. A request for a
discretionary CoC also should not be made if the human subject research is federally funded.[7]
We also prefer that all requests for discretionary CoCs be submitted electronically as described
in this section and with the information and assurances as detailed in this section.

To make a request to FDA for a discretionary CoC, the requestor should determine the
appropriate Center and submit the request, in the form of a letter (e.g., as a PDF attachment to
the email submission), through one of the following email addresses:

Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at: CDER-CoC[Requests@fda.hhs.gov](mailto:CDER-CoC-Requests@fda.hhs.gov)

for participants in research. FDA recommends that sponsors and investigators explore ways to further enhance their
own privacy and confidentiality procedures.
7 As noted in Section II, CoCs for federally funded research are mandatory and outside the scope of this guidance.
Mandatory CoCs for federally funded research are handled in a different manner than discretionary CoCs.

**V. FDA Review and FDA Issuance of Discretionary CoC**

After a request has been sent to the appropriate Center responsible for the FDA-regulated
product, a review will be conducted to ensure the requestor has submitted all the information and
assurances, described in Section IV. After FDA completes its review, the Center will send an
electronic response letter to the requestor indicating whether or not the discretionary CoC has
been granted. If granted, that electronic response letter will serve as the CoC. It is expected that
most discretionary requests will be granted provided these are in compliance with the statutory
requirements. The recipient of the CoC is expected to carry out the statutory assurances
provided in the request and reiterated in the FDA electronic response letter for the protection of
the individuals participating in the human subject research.
