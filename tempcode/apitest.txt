To use this API:
```python
# Upload CSV file with questions
curl -X POST -F "file=@questions.csv" -F "output_format=text" "http://localhost:8000/batch-query/upload"

# Submit list of questions
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"questions": ["Question 1?", "Question 2?"], "output_format": "json"}' \
     "http://localhost:8000/batch-query/list"
```

This setup provides a robust solution for batch processing questions while maintaining flexibility in how results are returned and formatted.
